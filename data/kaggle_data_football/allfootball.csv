0,Exclusive: Former Chelsea manager not offered himself to Barca as Xavi successor,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Exclusive-Former-Chelsea-manager-not-offered-himself-to-Barca-as-Xavi-successor/3299287,11 Feb,"The Barcelona managerial situation has been the subject of speculation ever since Xavi Hernandez announced that he would be stepping down as head coach at the end of the season. Club bosses wonât rush into making a decision, although there has been plenty of noise over the last two weeks.  Barca Atletic coach Rafael Marquez and Bolognaâs Thiago Motta have both been linked with the position, although as Fabrizio Romano has told Caught Offside in his exclusive column, neither are in line to be a serious candidate. The same can be said for Antonio Conte, who reportedly offered himself to Barcelona in recent days. âIâm told itâs not true that Antonio Conte has been offered to the club as a candidate to be their next manager. At the moment there is nothing ongoing between Conte and Barca, itâs all quiet. The same is true with Thiago Motta â he is not in the frame for the job at the moment, heâs going to stay in Italy and work in Italy next season. Itâs also completely quiet with Rafael Marquez.â Romano also addressed the ongoing speculation surrounding Hansi Flick, who has emerged as a leading contender for the Barcelona job. âWith Hansi Flick, Iâm told he would be super happy to come to Barca, heâs super open to this possibility. But itâs on Barca â Laporta and Deco have to decide who is the manager they want, and at the moment they have not made a decision, it will still be some time before we know the new Barca coach.â There are sure to be plenty of twists and turns on the Barcelona managerial situation over the coming months. One thing for certain is that Xavi is not considering staying on in the role, despite an upturn in form over the last couple of weeks.","There are sure to be plenty of twists and turns on the Barcelona managerial situation over the coming months.

2,Neville says Man Utd were 'NAIVE' not to have a sporting director for 10 years,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Neville-says-Man-Utd-were-NAIVE-not-to-have-a-sporting-director-for-10-years/3302799,8 hours ago,"Manchester United legend Gary Neville has called his former club 'naÃ¯ve' after years of operating without a sporting director.  Mail Sport exclusively revealed on Wednesday that the Red Devils are on the cusp of reaching an agreement with Newcastle over sporting director Dan Ashworth, who is keen on swapping St James' Park for Old Trafford. The 52-year-old is seen as the best in the business by incoming Man United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team, and the focus of his remit would be recruitment. Ashworth has not had as much control as he expected at Newcastle, the club he joined in the summer of 2022. There has been no fallout but it is thought the lure of the project at Man United, and his relationship with INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford, has persuaded him the time is right to move on.  Discussing Ashworth's imminent move to Old Trafford on the Stick to Football podcast by Sky Bet, Neville urged that Manchester United have been 'naÃ¯ve' and lost out on millions during negotiations without a sporting director. 'Agents have a bad reputation in football, but ultimately, they won't do someone over that they work well with, because they won't get the next gig. If an agent screwed over Liverpool, that agent wouldn't work with Liverpool again and it would spread quite quickly,' Neville said. 'Manchester United haven't had a sporting director for the last 10 years, so they've been so naÃ¯ve at that level. I imagine when they've been dealing with agents, if United called you, you knew you were going to get another Â£20-30million because they were naÃ¯ve and didn't have a relationship with agents.' Recruitment is Ratcliffe's number one priority at Manchester United, with the rebuild of Old Trafford secondary. INEOS are determined to find a better balance to recruitment than what has been achieved over the past 10 years and have identified Ashworth as the ideal lead to a new-look team. After impressing at West Bromwich Albion, Ashworth became the FA's Director of Elite Development in 2012 and pioneered 'England DNA', a player development plan for both the men's and women's teams. Despite attracting interest from United, Ashworth moved to Brighton as technical director in 2019 before taking on his new role at St James' Park in February 2022. Neville continued: 'Dan Ashworth did a good job at West Brom, but I was there with England when he was appointed, and it was a big change when he came in. It was quite a jolt at the time for Roy Hodgson to have a technical director like Dan Ashworth, who then brought in Dave Reddin who was a performance director.   'This was then they started talking about different types of coaches (e.g. attacking and defending coaches), and they were talking about attacking set piece coaches, breaking the game down to intimate detail, which was something Roy wasn't used to. 'I remember Dan having a conversation with Roy, but they were building all these foundations, where he started with the U21s, the U18s and with the women's team. You think of the success of all those teams in recent years, but that has been in the making for eight years, and it all started when Dan came in. 'Iâm not saying heâs responsible for what happened, but he had a big influence with FA. They were a terrible organisation from a professionalism point of view, and I felt what he did, he put processes in place where theyâre now structured and organised.'","'Iâm not saying heâs responsible for what happened, but he had a big influence with FA.

3,The secret conversations of the Premier League REVEALED...,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/The-secret-conversations-of-the-Premier-League-REVEALED.../3301266,13 Feb,"In another thrilling weekend of Premier League action, the agony and ecstasy of the world's premier football competition was on full display.  Excitement has thus far being the name of the game and the 2023-24 season is on course to set a new record for total goals in Premier League history. Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool all picked up wins to strengthen their title ambitions, with all three showing no signs of slowing down their charge towards the top spot as we approach the final third of the campaign. Meanwhile, the battle of the chasing pack continues with Manchester United securing what could prove to be a crucial three points in the race for Champions League football as they left it late to defeat Aston Villa. Elsewhere in the table the competition for points is just as fierce, with Sheffield United defeating Luton to keep a glimmer of hope alive that they can make the most unlikely of pushes for Premier League safety. To gain a deeper insight into the emotions involved in top flight football Mail Sport have enlisted forensic lip-reader Jeremy Freeman to offer his analysis on what was said in some of the weekend's most animated incidents. After narrowly escaping relegation last season, Nottingham Forest once again find themselves dicing with death at the wrong end of the table. Steve Cooper's sacking in December was followed by back-to-back wins for Nuno Espirito Santo, but that new manager bounce could yet be negated by a possible points penalty for breaking the league's financial rules. The Tricky Trees are now slipping back into their old ways on the pitch and found themselves winless in three ahead of Newcastle's visit to the City Ground. Bruno Guimaraes gave the visitors the perfect start, but Forest fought back twice to head into the interval level. In the second-half Taiwo Awoniyi was brought down by Martin Dubravka, with former referee Mark Clattenburg telling Mail Sport it was 'impossible' for the striker to stay on his feet.    However referee Anthony Taylor did not point to spot, leading to furious protests on the Forest bench captured on the broadcast that were only exacerbated after the referee cautioned Santo's assistant, Rui Pedro Silva. In his analysis of the clip, Freeman noted the No 2 saying: 'Hey? Hey? [indecipherable] That is nothing. I was sitting on the bench, I was sitting on the bench, man, of course, sitting on the b****y bench.' Things would go from bad to worse for the hosts in short order, with Guimaraes again popping up to fire Newcastle to victory and secure the three points. After victory over Liverpool kept their title ambitions alive, Arsenal travelled to the London Stadium on Sunday intent on reaffirming their status as genuine contenders. Mikel Arteta's side wasted little time getting down to business at the London Stadium. With the game still level in the early stages Alphonse Areola attempted to kickstart a counter for the Hammers by launching a throw towards Edson Alvarez on the left flank. The summer signing's first touch flattered to deceive however, and he was forced into a rash challenge to deny an onrushing Bukayo Saka possession.    With the England international left writhing on the pitch, Alvarez was shown a yellow card, and, according to Freeman was not expecting his caution. 'No, no, nah, no, he didn't hurtâ¦(referee then brandishes yellow)â¦what?' Gabriel then involved himself by squaring up to Alvarez with the pair exchanging heated words. 'F**k off, you dirty c***t,' Freeman believes Gabriel to have told the West Ham defender - with the second expletive matching the lip patterns and the context of the situation. Alvarez retorts: 'F**k off Magalhaes (Gabriel's surname), how can you...' before the camera cuts away. The Brazilian would ultimately have the last laugh, joining Saka on the scoresheet in a 6-0 thumping as they handed the Hammers their joint-heaviest home defeat in Premier League history. For as jubilant an afternoon as Sunday was for the Gunners it was equally as devastating for David Moyes. The Scotsman's second spell in charge at the east London club has been punctuated by moments of triumph followed by sinking despair, and unfortunately for Moyes recent results have fallen squarely in the latter category. Such was the disappointment of the defeat, contract extension talks for the manager have been paused, with the club now winless in their last seven games in all competitions.   Freeman's analysis of the former Everton boss's words captures the frustration of a manager watching his team completely blown out of the water. In the 84th minute, the cameras cut to an exasperated Moyes, who can be seen muttering to himself after Jakub Kiwior is penalised for a foul on Mohammed Kudus: 'For f*** sake, it's about time, how many times, it's not [indecipherable}... count how many fouls'. While West Ham's momentum has ground to a halt in recent weeks, Manchester United have very much been in the ascendency. Erik ten Hag has spent much of the campaign to this point trying to reignite the success of his maiden term in Manchester and with a youthful spine at its core it looks to finally be underway. Against Aston Villa, United faced one of their primary rivals for a Champions League place and proved they can get a result at a critical juncture of the campaign. Rasmus Hojlund continued his fine form in front of goal with a fifth in as many games, before Douglas Luiz equalised for the hosts and likely ruffled a few feathers with an exuberant goal celebration.    How fitting then that the pair would come together in stoppage time after substitute Scott McTominay had fired United back into the lead with a header in the closing minutes of normal time. As Hojlund walked off the pitch after being replaced by Jonny Evans, the young forward enraged the Villa Park faithful by gesturing at them to calm down and reminding them of the score. Luiz then confronted the Dane, with Freeman noting he said: 'You s***, come on, you know, you push off, just go off,' as he attempted to hasten his departure. A more fiery remark was still to come however, with a fan wearing a club-branded hoodie aiming a expletive-laden diatribe at the 21-year-old and appearing to refer to the him as a 'n***e'. 'You f*****, f*** off, you f****** n***e,' he could be seen shouting at the Dane.","'You f*****, f*** off, you f****** n***e,' he could be seen shouting at the Dane."

5,Barcelona receive good news from La Liga ahead of Champions League showdown with Napoli,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-receive-good-news-from-La-Liga-ahead-of-Champions-League-showdown-with-Napoli/3301364,14 Feb,"The Champions League represents the only realistic chance of Barcelona winning a trophy this season, given that they lost in the Spanish Super Cup final, are out of the Copa del Rey, and are 10 points adrift of Real Madrid in the La Liga title race. Even then, Xavi Hernandezâs side will be considered as outsiders to win their sixth ever European cup, given that they have been poor over the last few months.  Still, they have as good a chance as any of winning the tournament, although they have a very tough task to get past Napoli in their last 16 tie, which kicks off next week with the first leg in Naples. If Barcelona can pick up a positive result in that one, they will have a good chance of reaching the quarter-finals. Barcelona have received some much-needed good news ahead of that second leg at Montjuic, as it has been reported by Relevo that La Liga have pencilled in their match with Mallorca for the 8th of March, which is a Friday. It means that they will have an extra day of rest before the match against Napoli, which takes place on the 12th. Itâs uncommon for Barcelona to play in La Liga on a Friday, itâll only be the second time this season that it has happened (vs Sevilla on MD3). Xavi and his players are sure to be grateful for the extra day to prepare, which they will certainly need.","Itâs uncommon for Barcelona to play in La Liga on a Friday, itâll only be the second time this season that it has happened (vs Sevilla on MD3).

Beginning with President Joan Laporta, a number of figures came out to share their grief at his passing.  âAlways by Barcaâs side and active in âBarcelonaismâ from Guardiola de Bergueda, his small and beloved homeland, the Culers will never forget you Joan, the Grandfather of Barca. My condolences to family and friends.â The likes of Marc Bartra, Alexia Putellas and Ansu Fati all posted on social media about Casals folllowing the news. Iconic for his beard and vintage Barcelona shirt, the genesis of his fame comes from an old cartoon. As highlighted by Esport3, Valenti Castanys originally drew a figure (that would come to resemble Casals later), before a statue of âthe grandfather of Barcaâ was erected outside of the original La Masia building. Casals began going to games regularly in the eighties, and quickly became a cult hero amongst Blaugrana fans.","Casals began going to games regularly in the eighties, and quickly became a cult hero amongst Blaugrana fans."

However, they will face an in-form Lyon side who have beaten Lille and Marseille in their last two outings.  LâÃquipe report that Michel Der Zakarian is set to change things up against Lyon, including a change of formation to a 5-2-3 instead of the 4-4-2 formation which he deployed against Nice. This change in formation should see changes throughout the pitch. The first of these changes coming in defence with ThÃ©o Saint-Luce dropping to the bench in favour of Lucas Mincarelli at left-back. With one additional defender, Kouyate should also start with LÃ©o Leroy the eventual casualty in midfield. TÃ©ji Savanier should drop back into midfield to form a double pivot. Two changes are also expected in the attack with Akor Adams and Arnaud Nordin joining Yann Karamoh.

9,Life as a WAG is not all it's cracked up to be: From the stress of the EPL,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Life-as-a-WAG-is-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-From-the-stress-of-the-EPL/3301285,13 Feb,"From luxury holidays and VIP experiences galore to almost unlimited spending power - the life of a WAG might seem like the stuff of dreams. Yet it's not all it's cracked up to be...  That's at least according to the partner's of three top footballers, who have described some of the difficulties that comes with the role - from the stress of matches and the 'emotional rollercoaster' of moving abroad to having to let their own careers take a back seat. Taylor Ward, the husband of Riyad Mahrez, is one of the stars of Married To The Game, a show that focuses on the lives of footballer's wives and will stream on Prime Video from February. She appears on the series alongside fellow WAGs Cat Harding, fiancee of Arsenal star Jorginho and Sara Gundogan, wife of Manchester City's midfielder Ilkay Gundogan. In advance of the documentary, all three spoke to MailOnline to offer an exclusive insight into their lives - from the highs to the lows. Here is what they revealed - Taylor Ward defended her husband Riyad Mahrez after he faced backlash for telling his sobbing wife 'it's part of the game, innit' while revealing a move to Saudi Arabia. Ward, 25, said people have 'misunderstood' the French-Algerian footballer's tone as he told her about the move from Cheshire to Jeddah in an emotional clip that went viral. Setting the record straight, she admitted his response to her being upset was blunt - but said that was down to French people being more 'to the point'. The footballer, who captains the Algerian national team, had been playing for Man City but telephoned her to say he had signed a four year contract with Al-Ahli in the Saudi Arabian pro league. Weeping as she recalls the moment in Married To The Game, she tells the Mail: 'Riyad rang me and basically told me we are moving to Saudi. I'm going to be sat at home on my own.'   Ward has now said: 'I was shocked that people picked up on that so much. 'It's funny because obviously from watching the trailer he has such a blunt response to me being upset but I think that's our relationship. 'He is very blunt - a bit tough love. Riyad is French and French people in general are very to the point. Also he is a man. I think he's only cried in front of me twice in our relationship and it was not the Saudi move - so that's just who he is.' She added: 'Riyad is very calm, he doesn't panic under pressure and he's very to the point and straight talking whereas I'm a bit of a flapper in those situations. 'I actually think as harsh as it sounds I think that's why we work because he kind of brings me back down to earth. He's very much like: 'It is what it is you need to get on with it.' 'If I had someone there consoling me patting my back saying 'oh I know life's so sad you are moving to Saudi' I would probably feel worse. 'We are just married and he is so supportive. Obviously as much as he is straightforward and to the point he is the most loving person ever. 'If I was really upset about the Saudi move or if I was really genuinely depressed and upset about it he wouldn't put us in a position where I would feel like that. 'I think he just knew it was kind of me panicking in the moment and having a wobbly and that I would be fine the next day. He knows how to deal with me that's for sure.'    Taylor and daughter Mila have this week flown out to Jeddah to make their move permanent after spending months house-hunting and moving back and forth between Saudi and the UK. She said: 'Originally when I said: 'If we move we will all be moving together' I wasn't thinking that it would be as far as Saudi Arabia. I was thinking maybe down south to London or something like that. 'Riyad had to go over straight away so we moved into a hotel. It took us a few months to find a house which we have found now.' She said their house is 'gorgeous' and that the main problem they had when house hunting was that some of the houses in Saudi Arabia were like 'palaces'. 'Honestly we were walking around them and I was like: ''I don't know what we are going to put in these rooms, we are running out of ideas. We can't live here! This is getting ridiculous. How many rooms there are?'' 'They were genuinely too big. I think we have found something now which is really nice. It's still really spacious but we are not going to be getting lost on different floors trying to find each other.'  Ward said the move came as a 'huge shock' that she didn't see coming. She said she has a close group of friends and family in Manchester - though her parents and two sisters live in Dubai. 'Recently every time I've been in Saudi my mum will turn up as it's only two hours away,' she told. 'My mum is interior designing our house in Saudi so she has been back and forth non stop and she loves it. 'She and Riyad get on like a house on fire from the day they met and I think he actually speaks to my mum and dad (former footballer Ashley Ward) than he does to me. 'Me and Riyad met not long before lockdown and around a week after he first met my parents we went into lockdown and he ended up moving in with me and my family, so from day one they have been inseparable.' 'We always said that if a move comes up and it's best for Riyad and best for our family we will take it and go together. A football career is such a short period of time that you just have to make the most of it whilst it lasts.' As for life when he retires â she says that they are thinking of a move to Dubai. Arsenal WAG Cat Harding avoids her fiancÃ© Jorginho for 24 hours after a defeat and says her life revolves around his schedule. The mother-of-two, 33, told MailOnline she isn't a big fan of football and doesn't know the offside rule â only agreeing to watch the sport when her 32-year-old husband to be is playing. In an exclusive interview, the singer gave an insight into being the spouse of a sportsman, saying there's 'no way' she can talk to Jorginho when he loses a game and they even have to postpone dinner plans because of his low mood. The Italian midfielder, who earns a reported Â£110,000 a week, proposed to Cat in December with a love heart rose display and violinist that was captured on camera for the upcoming TV show. And now the former Voice UK contestant is planning their elaborate wedding set to be held in Italy, excitedly revealing she has already chosen her dream dress.    Cat said: 'I do feel like I am married to the game. 'It changes a lot of thingsâ¦ your whole life revolves around the schedule of your partner but to another level because it's not a normal schedule where you can plan. Everything has to be planned around what's going on with them. 'You can't plan anything in advance unless it is in June. I am planning my wedding for next summer because J could possibly be in the Euros this year again so it will be next year. 'Even certain things like we have often had dinner planned with friends and if they lose a game, we have to cancel and I feel the worst but there's no way you can go out with someoneâ¦ after J has finished a game and they lost, there is no way I can talk to him for 24 hours. He is not in the mood.' Cat, who is a mum to daughter Ada, eight, from her relationship with Hollywood actor Jude Law, 51, and shares son Jax, three, with Jorginho, says she didn't win over her fiancÃ© by pretending to like football. In fact, Cat has only recently learned there are 11 players in a team and admits the rules of the game are still a mystery to her. She said: 'I am not crazy into football and I have never pretended that I am. I don't know anything about it. 'I love going to the games because it is a completely different atmosphere and it is different when you are at the game, you can feel the energy in the stadium, compared to when you are watching it at home.    'I don't watch football other than when he is playing. I don't know any of the rules, I don't know the offside rule, I don't know anythingâ¦ he tries to explain it to me. I honestly just learned there are 11 players.' Shortly after their engagement, the couple, who originally met on a dating app, moved into a new home in London's West Hampstead to be closer to Ada's school and Jorginho's training ground. Despite a hectic start to the year, Cat has already found her wedding dress and is planning to scope out venues in Italy ahead of their big day in the summer of 2025. She said: 'We got engaged on December 6 so right before Christmas. 'We had family over from Brazil afterwards, we had the kids here, we were so busy and then it was Christmas, then we went away and since we got back, we moved house. 'But I did say to J last night I think I'm going to go to Italy next month and start looking at venues. 'I think I have found my wedding dress but it is the second dress I have tried on so I probably need to go to some other shops.'  Jorginho's commitment to the game, which has seen him win UEFA men's player of the year, means he is often apart from his family. The father-of-three, who also has a son and a daughter from his first marriage to Natalia Leteri, explained the biggest sacrifices are the special moments he misses with his children. Speaking on the show, he said: 'Everyone thinks football is happy and you have no problems, but we sacrifice a lot. 'The biggest one is being away all the time and not being close and missing many important moments... the kids growing up... it's not as easy as people think and that's the reality.' Married to the Game viewers will have the chance to watch the Euro 2022 winner's romantic proposal, which Cat says has earned Jorginho bragging rights amongst his teammates. But making a TV moment of the intimate occasion wasn't Jorginho's intention as Cat reveals he's shy off the pitch and as a performer she's more outgoing in their relationship.  She said: 'J didn't want to propose on camera, that's one thing he wanted to hold back on. 'He's actually a lot shyer than me especially when he doesn't know someone. He really takes time to analyse a situation and know what's going on, he's not very forward at first. 'But it felt absolutely amazing. I was expecting it but how he managed to trick me in the moment, it was a whole other thing. He put in so much work and he went above and beyond to make it special. He is quite something. 'He is now giving tips to other players and friends about how to do proposals.' Cat hopes watchers will see there's more to the wives and girlfriends of Premier League players than luxury holidays, beautifying and designer bags, as she labels 'WAG' a 'stupid term.' She said: 'It is still used so much. It doesn't affect me that much, I laugh at it. 'I don't like it or think it's right. We have our own lives and do our own things, other wives and partners of the players are really successful women in their own right so I don't think it should be a term that is used to label them. 'But for me personally, I just let it goâ¦ it doesn't affect my life or how I feel about myself it's just a stupid term.' Sara Gundogan has revealed she misses living in Manchester despite her previous criticism of the city's 'horrible' food. Gundogan, previously Sara Arfaoui, started dating former Man City star Ilkay Gundogan in 2021 before they tied the knot a year later. They have one son together, Kais, who was born in March 2023. Sara was a highly-successful TV presenter and model before meeting Ilkay, with the couple relocating to Barcelona this summer after the midfielder joined the Catalan giants upon the expiry of his contract at the Etihad. He enjoyed a hugely decorated seven-year spell with City, winning 14 trophies, which included captaining Pep Guardiola's side to a historic Treble last season.   However, things were sometimes tricky off the pitch, with Sara infamously criticising Manchester on occasions, which included one rant about the quality of the food in October 2022. She posted on her Instagram story: 'Sorry, I'm sad to be honest but nothing. I tried [sic] so bad to find a good restaurant but horrible food everywhere. 'Can't find a real Italian or good sushi or just fresh foodâ¦ everything frozen. Restaurants here are focus [sic] on making money with drinks and shot [sic] like nightclubs, not quality food. Maybe in London but in Manchester nothing. I'm sorry.' However, speaking exclusively to Mail Sport, Sara revealed that she grew to love Manchester and actually found it hard to leave in the summer. 'When I was in Manchester, my whole life was (originally) around football,' she said. 'My friends were football, the people I met through my husband, and then I didn't have anything that was just my world outside of that. 'And I'm a social person. So it took me a bit of time, but I made it friends and it was really nice. 'After making friends, I was really happy. I had my own life and routine in Manchester and I have one of my best friends there.'    There were several rumours about Ilkay's future in the summer, with the midfielder linked with clubs across the globe, while there was also a chance he would stay at City. And Sara went onto explain the difficulty of leaving Manchester behind after finding out her husband would be moving abroad. She added: 'Over the years I would see friends moving so it's something that's always around in football and you would suddenly just have a phone call from them telling you they're going to another country. 'So, it's always around, it's always happening but I didn't imagine that it would be us and when it's you it's big a shock. 'It's always sad, especially because you make friends, you're happy somewhere, you build your life and then you have to leave all the people you love.' Sara also reflected on her initial struggles in Manchester and explained how sticking with things ultimately paid off. She added : 'I think it's really hard to live in England when you are alone in the house and you can't meet anyone. 'But when you start to know a bit more about it, how to go around and have friends, I think the place changes completely and you can enjoy it. 'I started to enjoy everything and I kind of miss Manchester now.'   Sara went on to list some of the challenges of being a WAG, including letting her own career take a back seat. 'As a wife sometimes you are on the side,' she exclusively told Mail Sport. 'But it was hard because despite my work as a TV presenter, the fact I speak six languages and travelled the world as a model, when I was him, everything I did, suddenly it became zero and I just became his wife. 'The people knew me before as a media star but when I became a wife, there is the tendency of the press to show wives of players in a certain way and it's like we have to fit this cliche. 'I lost a bit my spontaneity, my way of speaking without thinking. So yeah, it's a bit hard, because you have to also rebuild yourself and find your own identity. 'It's kind of sad because there is no other sport, there is nothing similar, say in cinema or politics, that will describe a wife of an important politician that way.' Sara also admitted she was 'shocked' at her husband's move to Barcelona and didn't initially believe the rumours.  'I didn't really believe those (rumours about joining Barcelona),' she said. 'Every summer and January, in every transfer market people would always come to me with rumours. 'Some people even used to text me to say ""you're coming to Italy?"" and I was never taking anything seriously. 'I had friends texting me saying I was coming back, and I was like, ""no"". It just happened. And the funny fact is that I didn't take it seriously. 'I was like, no it cannot be because my husband is many years here in Manchester and I don't see this happening. She continued: 'I was in Italy, it was holiday time. It was my first holiday with my baby and I went to meet all my friends. So I was a bit in my bubble, let's say baby bubble. 'And I just got a phone call and it was like ""we are going there"". I wasn't taking it seriously. I don't know if it was a shock. So it took me a bit of time to realise what was happening.'","'And I just got a phone call and it was like ""we are going there"". I wasn't taking it seriously. I don't know if it was a shock. So it took me a bit of time to realise what was happening.'"

Grealish, handed his first start in six matches, lasted just 21 minutes of the holdersâ largely straightforward last-16 first-leg success at Parken Stadium before being forced off with a groin injury. Silva, who put City into a 2-1 lead just before the break with a fine flicked finish, took a knock to the ankle late in the game. Bernardo Silva, centre, takes on FC Copenhagenâs Rasmus Falk, right. and Magnus Mattson  The double blow comes after Josko Gvardiol missed the game with an ankle injury and Mateo Kovacic was also unavailable. City manager Guardiola said: âItâs something muscular with Jack, his groin. âHe felt it on the grass, started to complain. The players can feel it immediately if itâs muscular. Itâs a pity, heâs gutted. âHe wanted to continue but we didnât want to make the damage even worse. Weâll make tests tomorrow. âBernardo has a big knock in his ankle and Josko is out two to three weeks. Kova is ready to come back.â The injuries took the gloss off what was a mainly comfortable night for City. Kevin De Bruyne celebrates his opener against FC Copenhagen  They took an early lead through Kevin De Bruyne and, dominant in all departments, should have led by more before Magnus Mattsson levelled after an Ederson error. Silva restored the lead and Phil Foden gave the scoreline a more realistic look in stoppage time. Guardiola said: âIt was really, really good. Iâm so proud we played at that tempo. It was perfect. âWe were patient in the right moments but itâs not done. I know how difficult it is. âItâs not decisive but a good result.

14,"Ferdinand reveals his preferred front six for England at Euro 2024, Kane leads",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ferdinand-reveals-his-preferred-front-six-for-England-at-Euro-2024-Kane-leads/3301621,2 days ago,"Rio Ferdinand has named his preferred front six for England at Euro 2024 as the huge tournament edges closer this summer.  Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate will have some huge calls to make for his England squad as they prepare to jet off to Germany at the end of the current season looking for their first piece of silverware since 1966. There has been plenty of debate around the England line-up and which players should get the nod to give the team the best chance of success - and former England and Man United defender Ferdinand has come up with his best six players at the front end of the pitch. Ferdinand, who was working as a pundit for TNT's Champions League coverage of Man City's 3-1 win against FC Copenhagen, was asked for his thoughts on the best attacking line-up after Phil Foden had netted City's third in stoppage time. His first two picks at right wing and up front were simple and surprised no one.  '[Bukayo] Saka right, [Harry] Kane up front,' he began - before his selections became trickier, adding. 'The left is tough man. [Jack] Grealish is injured now. [Marcus] Rashford hasnât been in form.' He was pushed for an answer by fellow former Three Lion Joleon Lescott, who asked him to give a verdict if everyone was fit. Ferdinand replied: 'If everyoneâs fit and flying Rashford plays for me on the left.' Lescott agreed with his front three selection, adding: 'Yeah Iâd go for that. I donât think thereâs a bad choice. I think everyone thinks you can get it wrong and say ""well if youâre picking him then you donât rate the other one"". I donât think thatâs the case. I think thereâs so much talent.'    Ferdinand was then asked who he would have in the No 10 role should England play a 4-2-3-1 formation. 'Iâd have Foden in there,' he said - off the back his impressive display for City. He also concurred with Lescott on a central midfield pairing of Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice behind Foden, with the ex-Everton man saying the trio would 'figure it out between them'. Ferdinand then pleaded with Southgate to ensure that he picked the same front six when he is asked to name his final squad later this summer. 'If Gareth needs any help deciding that Iâm here - Iâll go on a Zoom call, Iâll even come around your house and thatâs your front six please!' England's preparations will continue with friendlies against Brazil and Belgium next month - before two warm-up games ahead of the Euros against Boznia and Iceland. They'll kick off their Euro campaign against Serbia on June 16, before rounding off the group against Denmark and Slovenia.","They'll kick off their Euro campaign against Serbia on June 16, before rounding off the group against Denmark and Slovenia."
15,"Man Utd told they're an ""odd bunch"" by Neville after his attack concerns emerge",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-Utd-told-theyre-an-odd-bunch-by-Neville-after-his-attack-concerns-emerge/3300784,12 Feb,"Manchester United legend Gary Neville has dubbed the current crop of Red Devils an ""odd bunch"" after Sunday night's dramatic 2-1 win away at Aston Villa.  Rasmus Hojlund fired Erik ten Hag's side in front early on to net his fifth league goal of the season, but Douglas Luiz levelled things up midway through the second-half. There was still time for United to respond and in the 85th minute, Scott McTominay's bullet-header left Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez with no chance. Though the win means United have taken a step closer to the Champions League qualification places, Neville has made clear he wants to see more from his former side - specifically the attacking trio of Hojlund, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho. ""The front three look more settled â Hojlund, Rashford and Garnacho,"" Neville told Sky Sports follwing the late win at Villa. ""Theyâre better than they were, but theyâre still not great. You still donât see any patterns or combinations. They concede so many chances. ""They donât control games. They donât keep possession better than other teams. But the do have players who can win matches. Theyâre a bit of an odd bunch. They just play in moments during matches."" With that being said, Neville did make clear that United are starting to turn the tide on their season and as a result the hopes of Champions League returning to Old Trafford next term are still alive. He added: ""We are now at the business end of the season. ""Itâs been so up and down for United. We are at the stage where they are six pointers. They couldâve been out of it but as they go over to those United fans, they go within five points and touching distance of being able to catch them [Villa]."" Ten Hag's side now have until next Sunday to recover before they are in action again, with the Red Devils's next outing coming in the form of another tricky away trip. This time, United meet Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. United go into that meeting with Luton off the back of three successive league wins and momentum is starting to gather. The expectant Old Trafford faithful are hoping that this time around, their side can hit form at the right stage of the season and return to the Champions League.","United go into that meeting with Luton off the back of three successive league wins and momentum is starting to gather.

16,Bayern 'join race for Xabi Alonso to replace the under-fire Thomas Tuchel',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Bayern-join-race-for-Xabi-Alonso-to-replace-the-under-fire-Thomas-Tuchel/3302603,18 hours ago,"Bayern Munich are increasingly likely to fire Thomas Tuchel, and are looking at Xabi Alonso as his replacement, according to reports.  Bayern boss Tuchel has come under-fire at the German giants, as they fell five points behind Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga title race, and lost 1-0 to Lazio in the Champions League first-leg. Alonso has provided sterling work at Bayer Leverkusen, guiding them to the top place in the German league, and he has been strongly rumoured as a potential successor to Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. But The Times report that Bayern are set to join the race for Alonso's services, with Tuchel's time at the club looking increasingly under threat in the summer following the club's struggles this term. They were eliminated early in the German Cup, and are up against it in the Bundesliga and Champions League competitions.  If the club did end the season without a trophy, Tuchel's first full campaign as Bayern boss would be deemed a failure by the club's notoriously high standards. Tuchel sent a damning message to his Bayern Munich players in an 'explosive dressing room statement' after falling victim to Bayer Leverkusen. Alonso's services are highly sought after, with Liverpool also looking for a new manager when Klopp leaves Anfield at the end of the season after nine years. The Sky Bet Fan View survey, conducted by YouGov, found 63 per cent of Liverpool fans asked want Bayer Leverkusen coach Alonso to be the club's next manager. Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard ranked second among fans, but far behind on 18 per cent. The 42-year-old Alonso knows the club well, having been on the books at Anfield from 2004 until 2009 - but he was also a Bayern Munich player between 2014 and 2017, which could complicate matters further. Leverkusen beat Bayern Munich 3-0 last Saturday to move five points clear at the top, and have league games against Heidenheim and Mainz before the end of February.   Tuchel's Bayern will look to overcome the disappointment of defeat to Lazio in league games against VfL Bochum and RB Leipzig in the coming weeks. Liverpool are currently two points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, and play Brentford on Saturday and Luton Town next Wednesday before taking on Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on February 25.","Liverpool are currently two points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, and play Brentford on Saturday and Luton Town next Wednesday before taking on Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on February 25."

18,"Hojlund, Garnacho & Rashford have a chemistry Man Utd have been crying out for",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hojlund-Garnacho--Rashford-have-a-chemistry-Man-Utd-have-been-crying-out-for/3300789,12 Feb,"In a week where Manchester United's Under-18s took another step towards an invincible season, it was to be a pertinent reminder of the value of the club's academy.  And despite the riches spent by Ten Hag on his, at times ailing, front line, it is two of the finest Carrington graduates, along with an in-form 21-year-old, that are proving to be the formula for success right now. It was to be Scott McTominay's day at Aston Villa, another product of the club's famed youth development, but, for the first half at Villa Park when United were at full complement, this was another reminder that Ten Hag finally has a front three he can depend on. For a lot of the season that hasn't been the case, not with Jadon Sancho spitting his dummy out and ending up in exile, or Antony not managing a goal or an assist until the trip to League Two Newport County last month. Prior to that Mason Greenwood, once heralded as the star striker of the future, was shipped out on loan to Spain. And so while he doesn't smile often, Ten Hag should smirk at the potential in his hands with a front three of Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.  At 26, Rashford is the elder statesmen of the trio - not a label he will relish, I'm sure. But with Garnacho only 19, and Hojlund only recently turning 21, Ten Hag now has a blueprint for the present and the future. This is a front three with pace, power, finishing ability and the arrogance all strikers need - check Hojlund winding up Aston Villa fans or Garnacho causing a stir with his celebration against West Ham. Rival fans will dismiss United's trio as lesser to their compatriots at Manchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool, but it is no fluke that when those three start, United more often than not win. From a five-game sample size where Garnacho has been deployed off the right, a position he is growing into by the game, Rashford off the left and Hojlund through the middle, United have won four, drawn one and scored 14 goals in the process. At 2.8 goals a game, Ten Hag may well have stumbled onto a formula for success in this race for the top four. 'We connect very good I think, with me now playing on the right,' Garnacho said after last week's win over West Ham. 'With Rashy on the left, putting in crosses, and Bruno in behind. We think we have a good team in the front. 'I always try to help the team, score and assist, but I don't care if I score or if it's Rasmus or Rashy who scores.'   There is no reason to doubt Garnacho's assessment either. Early on at Villa Park, United looked to spring a quick counter-attack and were it not for the offside flag a scampering Hojlund had the ball ready to be played across to an unmarked Garnacho for a tap-in. Also in that first half, Rashford created the most chances from the trio, instead playing the role of playmaker, even if it didn't result in a goal. 'There's balance to Manchester United's attack,' came Gary Neville's assessment during commentary. 'Rashford's best position is on the left and he's been pushed to the right at times. Garnacho has got a lot of confidence, has all the attributes of a potential great striker.' Watching the trio there is that sense of adventure, that boldness that excites fans. And not the sort of false dawns Antony delivers with his ever predictable need to cut onto his left foot. Rashford will have been disappointed to have come off but when it was Luke Shaw behind him - he was taken off as a precaution at half-time - he was a willing runner and gave Matty Cash plenty of problems. That's positive heading to Luton next week. Once Victor Lindelof, a centre back given the thankless task of slotting in at left back for the second half was behind him, things became tricky.  For now, just as it has been since Boxing Day, this United attack is as good as Hojlund wants it to be. Fourteen matches without a Premier League goal had the usual cliches thrown at the Â£72million forward. He's too young; he's too inexperienced; he's not clinical enough; the list goes on. But five goals in his last five matches, or six in his last seven, mean that no player has scored more league goals than the Dane since Christmas Day. It was striking too to notice the difference in celebrations between his goal against Villa at Old Trafford and his one here, where he swivelled brilliantly away from John McGinn to convert Harry Maguire's headed knockdown. Yes, timing matters. His goal at Old Trafford was the winning goal in front of an amped-up home crowd and his first in the Premier League. That came with an almost primal scream, that feeling of complete and utter relief that he was finally off the mark. At Villa Park, however, there was a coolness and a swagger to how he celebrated putting United 1-0 ahead. It wasn't a surprise - and going forward it shouldn't be. That's 11 for the campaign now. With United still fighting in the FA Cup, Hojlund will be targeting 20 goals in his first season in England which would be some doing after such a ponderous start.  'He looks a different player, he looks strong, he looks aggressive,' former United captain Roy Keane said of Hojlund. 'Hard work, a bit of desire, and certainly that bit of confidenceâ¦ you can see it in his body language. If United want to get in that top four/five he needs to keep scoring goals. 'Something has definitely changed in the last few weeks. That chemistry is certainly building and [it] will hopefully get better.' Hojlund's purple patch is emblematic of this new-look United attack. Rid of the inconsistency the likes of Antony have shown time and again and full of the pure finishing all three starters now possess. It may not be Erling Haaland, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku, but Manchester United's youthful renaissance in attack is one Ten Hag can finally depend on.","It may not be Erling Haaland, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku, but Manchester United's youthful renaissance in attack is one Ten Hag can finally depend on."
19,Tuchel laments Upamecano 'unecessary' red card in Bayern UCL defeat to Lazio,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tuchel-laments-Upamecano-unecessary-red-card-in-Bayern-UCL-defeat-to-Lazio/3302049,1 day ago,"Thomas Tuchel called out Dayot Upamecano for giving away the penalty that saw Lazio claim their first-leg round of 16 win against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night.  The Bundesliga champions were looking to bounce back quickly from their difficult weekend tie against league leaders Bayer Leverkusen, but found themselves unable to push past their hosts in Rome. After failing to convert a number of strong first-half chances courtesy of Harry Kane and Jamal Musiala, Bayern Munich's fortunes went from bad to worse after the break. A hefty challenge from the France international on Lazio's forward Gustav Isaksen not only saw a penalty handed to their opponents, but Bayern go down to 10 men after Upamecano was given a straight red card. Ciro Immobile was able to smoothly convert the penalty and send Lazio through to the second-leg at the Allianz next month with a slender lead.   After the final whistle, the former Chelsea manager stressed that he was 'frustrated' with the result, and his player's actions - but reserved criticism for the whole team performance itself. 'We're frustrated and angry about the defeat,' Tuchel said. 'I think we lost the game, I'm not sure Lazio won it. 'We did everything we could to fall behind, making errors and losing confidence. (There was) no need for Upamecano to go in like that. It's not wild or intentional - but just block the shot.' As the clock ran down, Bayern Munich looked increasingly impatient hunting for an equaliser, but it was Isaksen who had arguably the strongest chance after the penalty and Lazio were unlucky not to go 2-0 up. Tuchel said that the defeat was 'completely our responsibility', citing early chances from his side that went untaken. 'We started well, had a chance in the first minute and then with Harry Kane and then with Jamal Musiala,' Tuchel continued. 'We had the game under control in the first half. 'But in the second our performance dropped inexplicably. We made too many individual errors and made our opponents stronger and we lost concentration. We lost our rhythm. 'It was completely our responsibility. We lost a game today that in the first half looked like we could not lose it.'   But despite having recorded his 10th defeat in his 43 matches in charge, Tuchel brushed off claims that his job was in danger. 'Worried about my future? No I am not,' he added. Before the second-leg on home soil in March, Bayern Munich will look to continue their climb to the top of the Bundesliga against sides including VfL Bochum, Freiburg, and RB Leipzig. The serial champions sit five points off Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who are unbeaten since the start of their impressive Bundesliga campaign.","The serial champions sit five points off Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who are unbeaten since the start of their impressive Bundesliga campaign."
20,"Arsenal ranking of their largest EPL victories: Everton, Blackburn, West Ham...",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-ranking-of-their-largest-EPL-victories-Everton-Blackburn-West-Ham.../3301168,13 Feb,"Arsenal have kept their title challenge well on track with a statement 6-0 victory away to West Ham. Mikel Artetaâs Gunners ran rampant at the London Stadium to keep the pace with Liverpool and Manchester City.  Itâs the Gunnersâ biggest-ever away win in the Premier League, but where does it rank overall? Weâve taken a closer look at Arsenalâs five biggest Premier League wins. Sat in his dugout at the London Stadium, David Moyes must have had horrible flashbacks to the time his Everton side got demolished by Arsenal almost two decades ago. The game is most memorable for Dennis Bergkamp putting in a late-career masterclass, notching three assists and a goal in a man-of-the-match display in the Gunnersâ final home match of the 2004-05 campaign. The legendary Dutchmanâs contract was up that summer, but he was persuaded to sign for one more year â Arsenalâs last season at Highbury â after being serenaded with chants of âone more yearâ from the Arsenal faithful that day. Arguably Arsenalâs finest hour in that legendarily sexy burgundy o2-sponsored kit of 2005-06, Thierry Henry was on fire with a hat-trick that took him to 150 Premier League goals â level with Cliff Bastinâs league record for the club. Wenger was delighted with his sideâs display against Steve McClarenâs sorry Smoggies and was keen to dish the credit around. âWe played our game and the goals came as a consequence of the quality of our game,â the Frenchman told the BBC. âOf course, Thierry scored three â and everybody nearly scored! But Reyes contributed with his final balls and the most important thing is that the team plays the game we want to play and plays with a great spirit.â In their next home game, Wengerâs Gunners lost 3-2 to West Ham â which proved to be the last-ever defeat they suffered at Highbury. The 2011-12 season was also notable for Arsenalâs record Premier League defeat â the infamous 8-2 away to Manchester United in the early weeks of the campaign. But come late winter, Arsenal had turned their form around and put their injury woes behind them. Deadline day additions Mikel Arteta and Per Mertesacker made a major impact and were really clicking by the time Blackburn came to the Emirates in February. Gael Givet was sent off for Steve Keanâs relegation-bound Blackburn, Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain notched a brace and Arteta also got himself on the scoresheet. A great Morten Gamst Pedersen free-kick proved scant consolation for Blackburn, whose misery was compounded with a Scott Dann own goal injury time. Itâs easy to forget now that Arsenal came in 2024 in a despondent mood. Back-to-back defeats to West Ham and Fulham at the back end of the year left their title hopes on the ropes and they went to be eliminated from the FA Cup at home to Liverpool. But Artetaâs men have bounced back in emphatic fashion with a 100% winning record in the Premier League, including a statement victory over Liverpool. Their reinvigorated, confident mood was typified by their brutal and ruthless display away to the Hammers, avenging their two earlier defeats to Moyesâ Hammers by hitting them for six. Arsenalâs one other six-nil win of the Premier League came against Ian H0llowayâs newly-promoted Blackpool in the early weeks of the 2010-11 season. The Tangerines made a great fist of survival, and weâre seemingly obliged to describe them as a breath of fresh air, but they were still very much finding their feet at that point. Theo Walcott scored a hat-trick, while Andrey Arshavin, Abou Diaby and even Marouane Chamakh got themselves on the scoresheet.","Theo Walcott scored a hat-trick, while Andrey Arshavin, Abou Diaby and even Marouane Chamakh got themselves on the scoresheet."
21,The love story between Lionel Messi and Newellâs Old Boys,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/The-love-story-between-Lionel-Messi-and-Newell%E2%80%99s-Old-Boys/3301120,13 Feb,"In the month of Valentineâs Day, Messi will face the team that he supports in a friendly game between Inter Miami and Newellâs Old Boys of Rosario.  After a long tour around the entire globe, Inter Miami return to the tranquility of the state of Florida with one more test before the start of the MLS season. The new campaign, one full of hope, will begin on February 21 for Gerardo âTataâ Martinoâs side against Real Salt Lake. There is just one game to go, and it is perhaps the most special for the Argentine star: Messi and Miami will face Newellâs Old Boys, from Rosario, Argentina, the team he loves. On June 24, 1987, the city of Rosario welcomed a boy who years later would become a football legend, but who was never able to make his professional debut in the city he grew up in. That is why Messi feels that he has a debt to pay to the place that gave him everything and the city he visits when he is on vacation. Messi has never forgotten the idea of one day playing for La Lepra. âPersonally there was always the idea, and even more so after having become world champion, of playing Argentine football. Ever since I started playing at Newellâs when I was little and going to the stadium, it was my dream to play there [for the first team],â the Argentine revealed in September 2023. âWhen I was seven or eight years old, I remember going with my dad, my uncle and my brothers. We always went to the stadium. If it wasnât a very complicated game that could end in trouble, like a ClÃ¡sico, we would go whenever we couldâ he acknowledged in an interview with Jorge Valdano in February of last year. On November 29, 2020, just four days after the death of Diego Armando Maradona, Messi decided to pay tribute to the former world champion, back when he was still wearing the colours of Barcelona. âThe night before the game I was with Antonela (Rocuzzo) and I told her: âI have to do something for [Maradona]...â I have something of a museum with trophies and t-shirts upstairs, so I went to see what there was. I was looking for a shirt from the National Team or something from him,â Messi admitted. When he scored his first goal after Maradonaâs death, he remembered it with an emotional gesture, putting on the famous red and black shirt. The Argentine found the Newellâs shirt that Maradona wore with in 1993 and decided to wear it to pay tribute to the player. âI donât know why it was there. I didnât even remember that I had it,â acknowledged Messi. Inter Miami and Newellâs Old Boys will meet this Thursday, February 15 from the DRV PNK Stadium. The game is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. ET / 4:30 p.m. PT.","The Argentine found the Newellâs shirt that Maradona wore with in 1993 and decided to wear it to pay tribute to the player. âI donât know why it was there.

22,Sporting Director Deco wants Barcelona to sign more muscle,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Sporting-Director-Deco-wants-Barcelona-to-sign-more-muscle/3301641,2 days ago,"Barcelona are unlikely to have much money to spend in the summer, and so the pressure will be on Deco to get it right with the players he can bring in. His view is that the Blaugrana need to bring in more physically gifted players.  According to Sport, Barcelona will look to get stronger and faster in the transfer market this summer, with Deco feeling they lack sufficient power to compete with their rivals. That is part of the thinking behind their interest in Everton midfielder Amadou Onana, who would give Barcelona that physical prowess in the middle of the park that they currently lack. âYou canât take a group of kids, dress them in the Barca shirt and expect them to win titles from one day to the next,â Deco said in a recent interview with Nascer do Sol. âThe team did not show, in many games, a physical and athletic capacity with which it could overcome its opponents.â The problem for Deco is that it cuts to the heart of a heated style debate at Barcelona, and by making out as if he wants to sacrifice technical quality for physical attributes, he is likely to receive plenty of stick from fans. Even if that is his intention, he would be better off phrasing it differently, or just not saying it all. After his recent comments about âbreaking from the pastâ went viral, Deco is having to learn quickly that saying the wrong thing will create problems for him.","The problem for Deco is that it cuts to the heart of a heated style debate at Barcelona, and by making out as if he wants to sacrifice technical quality for physical attributes, he is likely to receive plenty of stick from fans.

23,Who are the top 6 British footballers to play abroad? Sutton reveals his picks,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Who-are-the-top-6-British-footballers-to-play-abroad-Sutton-reveals-his-picks/3301250,13 Feb,"Chris Sutton has picked his top five British footballers to play abroad on Mail Sport's podcast It's All Kicking Off.  With the likes of Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham now flying the flag in the Bundesliga and LaLiga respectively, there's a great debate to be had over the best exports from these shores. For Sutton, two Welshmen feature and his former team-mate Paul Lambert also makes the cut for his Borussia Dortmund heroics. Speaking on the latest edition of the podcast, Sutton talked through his list and explained his reasoning to Ian Ladyman. He said: 'So the best five British footballers to play abroad. In fifth place, Paul Lambert. My old team-mate at Celtic went from Motherwell to Borussia Dortmund and had a major part in winning the Champions League. So Paul Lambert at number five.  'At four, Steve McManaman. I think he was brilliant at Real Madrid. Excellent player he was at Liverpool, scored a goal in the Champions League final, won endless trophies at Real Madrid, he would be in at four. 'At three, don't like football outside the Premier League era, but John Charles, the gentle giant, could play up front and at the back. He has to be in because he was one of the pioneers, one of the first guys to go and play abroad, went to Juventus, I think 1950, well, not I think, I know 1957, won three Serie A titles for Juventus, wonderful football and my dad used to talk about John Charles a lot so he would be at three. Sutton went on to reveal the two top talents he puts above the rest in this debate. 'At two, Gareth Bale has to be in there somewhere, five Champions League titles, the scorer of one of the greatest ever Champions League goals, endless trophies at Real Madrid,' he reasoned. 'I don't know whether he was always appreciated by the Madrid fans though but he would be in at two. 'And at number one, Chris Waddle. He went to Marseille in the early nineties, won league titles there, got that Marseille team, brilliant team as it was in the early nineties, to a European Cup final and more importantly he can still go back to Marseille 30 years on from his time as a player and he doesn't have to buy a drink in the place. 'So that's why Chris Waddle, he was a genius of a player, he used to love watching him, that's why he would be at number one.' Ladyman went on to remind Chris of some of the other top players he left out who may have warranted inclusion. He said: 'I think David Platt has got to be in the top five. Bari, Juventus, Sampdoria. Kevin Keegan, European player of the year while he was at Hamburg. John Aldridge, one of the first non-Basque players to play for Real Sociedad, 40 goals in 75 league appearances for Sociedad, he was a roaring success over there. He added: 'Gary Lineker at Barcelona, 42 goals in 103 La Liga games, hat-trick against Real Madrid, Copa del Rey winner, cup winner's cup winner. David Beckham didn't win an enormous amount at Madrid but also went on to play at LA Galaxy in LA, PSG, Milan, certainly an ambassador for English football at the time.'    And one big omission Sutton then mentioned was Glenn Hoddle, who spent four seasons at Monaco from 1987-91. 'So you left out Glenn Hoddle and I'm really surprised,' he said. 'But you're just mentioning names and you're probably going to you're probably' going to regret not mentioning Graham Souness because you're terrified of him. 'Top five British players to play abroad. Let us know what you think.'",'Top five British players to play abroad. Let us know what you think.'

Milan won 1-0 thanks to Theo Hernandez's winner. ""Milan had a ferocious pressing in the first half and fell back after the break. We did well, but could've done better to make the most of their dip in fitness levels,"" Mazzarri told DAZN. âI don't think the change of system was the key to playing better in the second half, we simply did better. âWe had worked all week on the movements to deal with Theo doing that give and go. I don't like specifying who made the mistake, but we had prepared to deal with it and a mistake was made. It was a predictable move, because that is a classic Milan move, so we should've closed off the through ball earlier. That is all I will say."" Napoli are seven points off fourth place. Mazzarri added, âThe objective is to win as many games as we can. It is possible. We had many injuries, missed important players, we had a great performance tonight and did not deserve to lose. âWe proved again tonight that we played well and could've taken three points if things had gone our way against one of the best teams in the league. âMany of those ahead of us have to come to Naples, so I have confidence we will challenge for at least fourth place.""","âMany of those ahead of us have to come to Naples, so I have confidence we will challenge for at least fourth place."""
25,"Schumacher's favourite restaurant: Cristiano Ronaldo, Haaland have visited!",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Schumachers-favourite-restaurant-Cristiano-Ronaldo-Haaland-have-visited/3302835,6 hours ago,"The worldâs best pasta maker is eating her lunch.  After a busy morning service, Rossella Giannini enjoys the silence. The silver-haired matriarch watches closely as her husband, Maurizio, divides the remaining contents of a large pan of ragu between himself, their son, Alberto, and daughter-in-law, Francesca, the family of four exchanging few words while waiters diligently prepare for the evening to come. It is rarely this quiet at Ristorante Montana. Situated a stoneâs throw from Maranello, the home of Ferrari, Rossella has fought an uphill battle to compete with the five-star hospitality on offer down the road, where men in suits pay a premium for a slice of Italian luxury. Yet the stars, it seems, gravitate here. It was Erling Haaland who, sat within these four wood-panelled walls, wrote âthe best pasta Iâve ever eatenâ on a napkin addressed to Rossella. âMino Raiolaâs father was a friend,â explains Maurizio, the footballing super-agent having recommended this hidden gem to the free-scoring Manchester City star before his death in 2022.    Haaland is one of countless footballing faces to make the trek to Ristorante Montana. Roberto de Zerbi, Gianluca Scamacca and even Cristiano Ronaldo have paid Rossella a visit - the famously diet-crazy Portuguese unable to resist Rossella's hearty cooking during a visit with former Juventus president Andre Agnelli some years ago. 'He ate fried dumplings with cured meats and pasta - lasagna, tortellini and gramigna - plus tiramisu for dessert,' Rossella recalls. She has admirers in Hollywood too, with actress Penelope Cruz and director Michael Mann sampling her famous pasta. But it is the drivers from La Scuderia who have made this place their home. RenÃ¨ Arnoux and Stephan Johansson were first to walk through her doors in 1986 while Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, the two men competing for the Prancing Horse this year, are regular visitors. Sebastian Vettel still pops in despite leaving the team in 2020 while a framed photo of a grinning Fernando Alonso hugging the Italian chef during his formative racing years is proudly displayed alongside photos of his fellow Ferrari alumni. There is one picture that inspires the most awe among this myriad of memorabilia, though. Stretched across the width of the wall, Rossella squeezes Michael Schumacher as he tucks into one of her staple dishes - tagliatelle with pork ragu sauce. 'To my mama Rossella,' reads the German's message, delicately-penned in Italian on the canvas. 'Thank you for everything.' Rossella looks on with a smile, her soft eyes aglow with admiration for the man who made it his mission to visit whenever in Maranello.     'Breakfast, lunch and dinner he would come here,' she tells Mail Sport as she clears the table. 'He was everything,' Rossella remembers her first meeting with Schumacher well. Acquainting himself with the local area after signing for Ferrari, the German arrived on her doorstep late at night. 'It was February 14, 1996 at 11.30 pm,â she recalls. âHe landed in Parma with his private plane and came to us with the press officer at the time, Mr. Claudio Berro. He had dinner on Valentine's Day evening. It was love at first sight!â Five world championships and many tagliatele dishes later, Schumacher has left an indelible mark on Maranello, as well as Rossella's heart. 'He called me his Italian mama and he was like another son to me,' she says with a smile, cherishing those unforgettable moments. It's been over ten years since Schumacher last visited Ristorante Montana, the German the victim of a shocking skiing accident on the French Alps in December 2013. His wellbeing has largely been kept from his adoring fans and he has not been seen in public since. Francesca, standing underneath a framed Schumacher racing suit nearby, utters: 'It's a tragedy.' But the Schumacher clan haven't forgotten about the woman who cared so deeply for Michael. While visits are few and far between since his son, Mick, left Ferrari's young driver programme, a trio of racing helmets belonging to the pair are perched on a shelf above the cash register. 'Mick and his mother visited last year,' Francesca says, before showing a photo of the young driver giving Rossella a warm hug. The connection still runs deep between the families after all of these years. The wheels keep on turning at Ristorante Montana on this grey February afternoon, where another successful night's trading fast approaches. Will a famous face pay a surprise visit this evening? Leclerc is in town to promote Ferrari's new partnership with Peroni, while a fever-pitch excitement is in the air over Lewis Hamilton 's upcoming arrival - the Briton having signed a lucrative deal to join the Scuderia from 2025.  The seven-time world champion has never frequented this Ferrari sanctuary but his father, Anthony, dropped by many years ago, long before Hamilton begun talks with the Italians over a shock switch from Mercedes. The follower of a strict vegan diet, will Rossella's famous tagliatelli be off the menu for Hamilton? 'I'm the boss here!' Rossella quips, excited at the prospect of cooking for the man desperately chasing a record-breaking eighth world title - a tally which will see him finally eclipse her darling Schumacher. 'He will have what I cook for him!' If he's anything like his fellow stars, Hamilton won't be able to escape the magic of this refuge. And the secret ingredient to Ristorante Montana's success? . 'It feels like home,' says Rossella.","'It feels like home,' says Rossella."
26,Chelsea sweating on Thiago Silva's fitness ahead of Carabao Cup final,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-sweating-on-Thiago-Silvas-fitness-ahead-of-Carabao-Cup-final/3301175,13 Feb,"Chelsea are sweating on Thiago Silva's fitness ahead of the Carabao Cup final after the Brazilian defender limped out of Monday night's 3-1 win at Crystal Palace.  The 39-year-old injured his groin sliding in to block a shot by Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta around the hour mark and could be seen shaking his head when going off. Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino later confirmed Silva felt something in his groin and would be assessed on Tuesday. Any potential problem would add to a growing injury list for the Blues ahead of their trip to Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday and the Carabao final with Liverpool at Wembley on February 25. They are already without defensive options as Benoit Badiashile faces a spell on the sidelines after suffering a groin injury of his own in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Aston Villa.   Wesley Fofana hasn't featured at all this season after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee during pre-season. Reece James and Marc Cucurella are also out at the moment but should return at some point next month. Chelsea came from a goal down to win at Selhurst Park thanks to a double from Conor Gallagher and another from Enzo Fernandez. The result left them 10th in the table but a little closer to the European places. Veteran defender Silva has started all but two of Chelsea's 24 Premier League matches this season and has also featured in six cup games, a sign of his continued importance to Pochettino. Silva has netted three times. Chelsea did consider selling Gallagher in January but much to his manager's relief, he stayed. 'Always he decided, what he told me, was to stay at Chelsea,' Pochettino said, before being asked if he should be tied down to a new deal.  'It is about him and the club,' the Blues boss added. 'I am not suffering from this type of thing. He still has one year more on his contract (expires June 2025). That is a matter for him and the club.' Chelsea have bounced back since being hammered at home by Wolves â a defeat which put Pochettino under pressure. Since then, they have beaten Aston Villa in the FA Cup and Palace here. 'I don't care about the rumours, the tension, the pressure or the stresses,' Pochettino said. 'We know really well what is our reality and we are going to keep working.'","'I don't care about the rumours, the tension, the pressure or the stresses,' Pochettino said.

In recent weeks, Ajax scouts have been spectators at Casa Pia games, where the match against Benfica last week (1-1) particularly attracted attention. However, the Amsterdammers were in good company. Scouts from Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, Manchester United and of course Sporting Portugal and Benfica were also present to see the talent at work. Fajarda is not contractually bound to Casa Pia and will most likely have clubs to choose from next summer.

28,Tuchel is 'keen to replace Xavi at Barca this summer' as he eyes move to Spain,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tuchel-is-keen-to-replace-Xavi-at-Barca-this-summer-as-he-eyes-move-to-Spain/3301673,2 days ago,"Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel has reportedly registered interest in replacing Xavi at Barcelona this summer.  Xavi revealed last month that he will be stepping down from his position at the end of the season, leaving the Catalan giants looking for his successor. And former Chelsea boss Tuchel has offered himself to Barcelona to take over in the dugout ahead of next season, according to Mundo Deportivo. Tuchel spoke glowingly about LaLiga in a recent interview as he talked up the prospect of coaching in Spain one day. 'Moving abroad would appeal to me again,' he admitted. 'Spain has an extraordinary league.  'From my perspective, and based on my experience working with Spaniards, they are characterised by a tremendous amount of self-confidence. 'When you speak with Spanish players, you quickly get the sense that you are engaging with the person.' This led to speculation linking him with the Barcelona job, but Bayern quickly moved to quash these rumours. A club statement read: 'Our head coach Thomas Tuchel was asked by supporters on Sunday as part of a fan club visit about his coaching career and his previous experiences abroad at Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, and naturally provided information about this during the discussion. 'He also answered general questions from fans about Spain as a footballing country. He never spoke about Xavi HernÃ¡ndez and his successor, as was falsely claimed afterwards. 'We will no longer accept such non-factual statements directed against our coach, which always come from the same source.' But Mundo Deportivo have reported that Tuchel is keen on managing Barcelona, and his prospects of landing the job could be helped by president Joan Laporta being a fan of German coaches. Tuchel has been at Bayern for less than a year and is contracted until June 2025, but there is uncertainty surrounding his future as the club's strangehold on the Bundesliga is in jeopardy.  Bayern were beaten 3-0 by Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday to fall five points behind their rivals in the title race. The club's CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen insisted Bayern are not considering sacking Tuchel, but the pressure is mounting on the 50-year-old. A sign at Bayern's training ground was defaced with a message reading 'Tuchel out' over the weekend, highlighting that all is not well in Bavaria right now. This may lead to Tuchel and Bayern parting ways, which could free up the former to move to Barcelona to help them return to competing for domestic and European honours.","This may lead to Tuchel and Bayern parting ways, which could free up the former to move to Barcelona to help them return to competing for domestic and European honours."

The Manchester City boss felt last seasonâs Golden Boot winner was beating himself up as the Premier League champions struggled to end Evertonâs resistance at the weekend. But Guardiola gave Haaland a few choice words at the break - and the 23-year-old responded with a double as the Blues kept up the pressure at the top of the table. City now step up their bid to retain the Champions League in Denmark - and Guardiola explained: âErling is young, playing in the most difficult position on the pitch, surrounded by four or five players with minor space. âIn that moment, he has to be positive. When he scored a goal, he reacted - but he doesn't need to score because he helps us for many things. He defines himself by goals but it is not just that. Itâs about clapping, encouraging his mates and the first intense press. âIf he doesn't score in 10 minutes, itâs okay. But in the process he has to try to be âlet's goâ because the team always wins when they overcome bad moments. âThere will be moments when we suffer. In those moments will we be sad and depressed or react? We cannot forget he has been two months out, which is a lot of time with a guy who is so tall. Back to being dynamic is not easy and he's a huge competitor who wants to score goals. We know, so relax.â Haalandâs goals at the weekend were his first since returning from a stress fracture of his foot that sidelined him for two months. Guardiola admitted he had been concerned with his teamâs body language - but believes that Cityâs willingness to go through the pain barrier is what sets them apart. He said: âIt looks like I am complaining about Erling but it was in general. How many games did Erling play and how many goals? His body language is not a problem. âIf he doesn't score tomorrow, it is the day after or next week. It's not a big issue, let's do it again - for him and everyone. Erling is so strong. He came to a team that had won two Premier Leagues but he adapted really well. âI have an incredible group of players that embrace the new players. They donât need two days to be part of the group, just one day. âErling felt it immediately. We never put pressure on him to have to score a goal, just be involved with what we have to do and the rest will come naturally. âHe coped perfectly because he's so strong mentally. You see his numbers at his age, not even Messi or Cristiano (Ronaldo) had these numbers at his age.â Guardiola added: âWe have to understand that in the opponentsâ team every player has a mama and a papa so they deserve to play good. ""How you handle those moments is what defines a big team. This is what we have done in the past and we have to do it again. âBody language is everything in life. You cannot be happy doing your job or improve. If you are not positive in your mind and accept you can make a mistake and accept you mate can make mistakes. âThese things are far beyond tactics. It is everything in life. If you don't train with a big smile thinking you can do better and help, you cannot improve. âDuring the season there are moments like that and people get frustrated. But they understand that sometimes the game doesn't work, it's how you face the problem to overcome it immediately. There are always gaps to improve.â","âDuring the season there are moments like that and people get frustrated.

31,Paramount+ aims new Champions League advert at Lionel Messi with cheeky message,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Paramount%2B-aims-new-Champions-League-advert-at-Lionel-Messi-with-cheeky-message/3300937,13 Feb,"Lionel Messi was the subject of a Paramount+ advert during the Super Bowl advising him how to watch the Champions League now that he is no longer playing in it.  Messi, 36, made his debut in the competition as a 17-year-old in December 2003 and has played in it every year since until this one. It is a tournament the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner won four times while at Barcelona and scored 129 goals in, mainly for the Catalan club, but also during a two-season stay at Paris Saint-Germain. Across two decades, Messi made 163 appearances in the competition but will not add to that tally after signing for Inter Miami. He does not have merely a spectator's brief over proceedings. Paramount+, the streaming service that airs the Champions League on behalf of CBS across the United States, used their 30-second-long Super Bowl advert to remind him how to watch the competition from his new home in Miami. The ad will have cost Paramount around Â£5.5million ($7m) to air, as that was the rough price of commercials during Super Bowl LVIII. It begins with the host of their Champions League coverage, Kate Abdo, addressing the camera. ""America, I'm not here to talk to you,"" she states as the words 'A MESSAGE FOR ONE PERSON"" appear. ""I'm talking to you,"" Abdo adds, pointing down the camera inside the CBS studio, ""the GOAT (greatest of all-time)."" Graphical representations of Messi's Barcelona, Argentina and Inter Miami number ten shirts then materialise on-screen. ""How's Miami?"" she asks before reminding him: ""(For) two decades you dominated Champions League soccer. Now what?"" Abdo answers: ""You'll have to watch it like us, but there's a time zone thing. They're (matches) in the middle of the day. ""So tell your bend it like boss (referencing the 2002 film 'Bend It Like Beckham,' referring to David Beckham, Inter Miami's president) you're 'training from home' Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and all the matches stream on Paramount+."" Abdo continued: ""So enjoy a month free on us. Try the promo code G-O-A-T."" The ad then cuts to a scene where Jamie Carragher, Micah Richards and Thierry Henry, pundits on CBS' Champions League coverage, are sat at chairs around a circular desk in the same studio holding mobile phones. ""It doesn't work for me,"" Richards remarks. Carragher concurs: ""Yeah, me neither."" Henry then replies: ""Well, it's working for me,"" while putting his phone on the desk. ""Try donkey,"" he tells Carragher while pointing at his fellow pundit, eliciting an eruption of laughter from the trio. And a reference to Carragher's tale of the time Messi called him a donkey. Messi could watch his two former teams play first knockout round ties over the next two Wednesday nights. PSG are first up as they host Real Sociedad this week before Barcelona travel to Napoli the following week. However, unfortunately for Messi, Inter Miami kicks off the MLS season against Real Salt Lake on the same day Barcelona plays.","Messi could watch his two former teams play first knockout round ties over the next two Wednesday nights.

The 61-year-old made the hilarious revelation when he was describing the loyalty that he has been shown by African players during his stellar managerial career. Mourinho coached the likes of Didier Drogba, Michael Essien and John Obi Mikel during his two stints at Stamford Bridge, while also working with other players from the African continent elsewhere around Europe as well. Having been sacked as Roma head coach in January following a difficult run of form, Mourinho is now waiting for the next offer that convinces him to get back into top level football. Delivering success at every club he has been at, with the exception of Tottenham, Mourinho has worked with some of the world's best players, boasting a cv of training Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Wayne Rooney and others.   But, the legendary Portuguese manager revealed how he has always been able to rely on African players throughout his career and explained how the likes of Essien have nicknamed him 'daddy'.

To be honest I love the guys and I feel that the African player is very loyal and very pure.   'Many of them they call me daddy and some of them they are almost my age when when Essien calls me daddy I say ""Michael Come on don't call me daddy, we're almost my age,' he joked.

Bayern meet Lazio on Wednesday in the first-leg of their round 16 tie. âI think that in football, it's normal to change formations,"" Tuchel said when asked about his tactics for the match. âThere are many teams that play different systems within the game. We need patience and composure. We already know what we want to do tomorrow; we had a tactical practice, we'll have a final practice, and then we have a defensive meeting, and we'll try to win the game. âWe play against an Italian team and I am not going to reveal anything because I know how tactically disciplined Italian teams and Sarri's teams are, so I won't say anything,"" he continued. âWe are not going to talk about the weaknesses; they are a disciplined team, they run a lot and they are homogenous. They play 4-3-3 and 4-1-4-1. They have a clear pressing system, they know how to defend deep and, as always with Sarri, there are close distances. It's going to be an emotional game."" He continued: âI can't imagine anyone underestimating this game, particularly after what happened on Saturday,"" Tuchel replied. âIt's important to not just criticise ourselves, but allow ourselves with confidence and show our confidence. âI've seen Lazio play very well at home, in the derby against Roma. If the stadium will play a role, we have to lean against that. We have to be ready and show our reaction. âWe showed a reaction after a defeat in a cup game, the team's self-criticism is not a problem. They always show this in their analysis. Even in games we win, we are not happy with everything we do. We are open and honest with the staff and the team. I am convinced we'll show a reaction, we already did it in the past. It's a good opportunity with a good opponent, in a new competition. It's 50-50 from the start.""","âWe showed a reaction after a defeat in a cup game, the team's self-criticism is not a problem.

One of the talents they have been linked with is Evertonâs Jarrad Branthwaite.  The 21-year-old has been impressive this season, and has been linked with Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United in the past too. Just over a month ago reports in England claimed Real Madrid were looking at Branthwaite, and now DM, as reported by Diario AS, claim that Los Blancos have enquired about his availability. There are conflicting reports on Real Madridâs plans this summer, with some claiming they will anticipate a move for a young central defender this summer that had been planned for 2025. Others say the only reinforcement will be the return of Rafa Marin from his loan at Alaves. Lilleâs Leny Yoro has been the most closely linked with Real Madrid in Spain, while Goncalo Inacio and Antonio Silva have also been suggested as shortlisted targets. It should be noted that all of the reports linking Branthwaite to the Spanish capital have come from England, and there has been little noise around him in Madrid.","Lilleâs Leny Yoro has been the most closely linked with Real Madrid in Spain, while Goncalo Inacio and Antonio Silva have also been suggested as shortlisted targets.

36,Blue card punishments 'WILL apply to goalkeepers' if new laws are introduced,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Blue-card-punishments-WILL-apply-to-goalkeepers-if-new-laws-are-introduced/3300900,13 Feb,"Further details surrounding the potential introduction of blue cards into football have been revealed.  Football fans and pundits were left baffled by the news on Thursday that the new card would be trialled to sin-bin players guilty of minor offences for ten minutes - with raged supporters claiming the new rule change would ruin the game. An introduction of the card would be the first new card in football in more than half a century, with yellow and red cards being introduced in 1970 and running to the present day. The proposals have received largely negative responses from Premier League managers, with Ange Postecoglou agreeing that the proposals would ruin the game and Mikel Arteta suggesting they could be trialled if they improve football. New details have raised further questions, however, with it initially unclear where goalkeepers and managers stood with the sin-bin idea. According to The Telegraph, however, those queries have now been answered.   The protocols are no different when it comes to goalkeepers, the report claims, with shot stoppers to be sin-binned the same as outfield players. meaning outfielders may have to go in goal. A substitute could still be made to bring a goalkeeper on, though that would result in the sin-binned goalkeeper coming back on and two goalkeepers being on the field. One could then only be removed via another substitution. If all the substitutions had been made, an outfield player would have to go in goal for the 10-minue period, then head back outfield when the goalkeeper returned. Blue cards, meanwhile, will not apply to managers and coaches, with the yellow and red card system only staying in place. There is uncertainty, however, around the role VAR will play in the inclusion of blue cards, with trials no to be initially held in top-tier competition. Nor do the protocols, reportedly, explain what would happen in the events of mass confrontations between groups of players and match officials. In good news for the Premier League managers and fans who have opposed he idea, proposals from the International Football Association Board (IFAB) have now been put on the back-burner following the growing opposition to the the idea - including from some of the biggest power-makers in the game, according to The Telegraph. Mail Sport reported last week how supporters had been up in arms over the idea, with some saying the game was 'finished' - while pundits like Paul Merson claimed it would make football 'boring'.    The latest report claims that unrest over the decision was summed up by a statement from FIFA, which confirmed sin-bin trials would not include top-tier competitions. 'Any such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels,' it read. It was initially reported that blue cards were set to be trailed in FA Cup matches from next season.",It was initially reported that blue cards were set to be trailed in FA Cup matches from next season.

There was one bright spark for the Blaugrana though, and increasingly he is becoming the positive for this season â 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.  The teenager was in inspired form, scoring twice, including a late equaliser where he unleashed a fierce shot from outside the box. Lamine Yamal took on plenty of responsibility during the match, and after being awarded the player of the match award, spoke with plenty of maturity too. âYes, we have been conceding these quick goals throughout La Liga. It is something that we must urgently improve because at the end of the day, it is what is costing us the points,â he remarked to Movistar+, as recorded by MD. The award mattered little to him in the grand scheme of things. âI am trying to work with the trust that the coach is giving me. I am very grateful to him, but now I am only thinking about the match and the lost opportunity before me.â âI am very grateful for the MVP. Itâs something you like, but Iâm sad about the defeat.â He converted his brace from an expected goals figure of just 0.65, the first a header at the back post, the second that effort from distance. His display was yet further evidence that he is their most dangerous attacking threat currently. Image via JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images",Image via JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images

While it appears there are some obvious candidates for major exits, the Blaugrana are not closing the door on a number of players leaving, including Alejandro Balde.  Ronald Araujo, Frenkie de Jong and Raphinha have been mentioned as potential oportunities for the Blaugrana to cash in, but a number of other players could be on the chopping block if the right offer comes in. That is the case for Balde, who is currently out injured until the end of the season. The 20-year-old burst onto the scene last year, replacing Jordi Alba and making the 2022 Spain World Cup squad, but struggled to repeat that form this season. MD say that if a high offer for Balde comes in, then they will evaluate it, although they are not planning on a sale. Last summer it was rumoured that Manchester City were interested in him, but he signed a new deal until 2028 with a â¬1b release clause. Loanee Alex Valle has been suggested as a first-team option when he returns from Levante, while Las Palmasâ Sergi Cardona has also been mentioned as a potential free option at the end of his contract, but both of these were initially slated as back-ups to for Balde. Marcos Alonso will not continue beyond the end of this year.","Last summer it was rumoured that Manchester City were interested in him, but he signed a new deal until 2028 with a â¬1b release clause.

In the end, they opted for Oriol Romeu, who re-joined the club in a low-cost operation from Catalan rivals Girona.  Despite a promising start, Romeu has massively struggled in recent months, and has barely been called upon by head coach Xavi Hernandez, who has even opted to play defender Andreas Christensen as a pivot ahead of the 32-year-old. Itâs now been revealed that one of the main reasons for Romeuâs struggles this season has been due to a âhidden injuryâ. As reported by RAC1, the problem was detected during his Barcelona medical last summer, but the club opted to sign him anyway as they desperately needed a new defensive midfielder. The problem has got worse in recent months, which has seen Romeu following a conservative treatment program â he was told that surgery would be the better option, but he turned it down on the basis that he wants to help Barcelona out between now and the end of the season. Over the last few matches, Romeu has played just 65 minutes, as Barcelona have taken the decision to minimise his workload in training and matches so that he is as fit as possible for the season run-in, during which the Catalansâ hope that they are fighting for a title.","Over the last few matches, Romeu has played just 65 minutes, as Barcelona have taken the decision to minimise his workload in training and matches so that he is as fit as possible for the season run-in, during which the Catalansâ hope that they are fighting for a title."

Erik ten Hag's men currently sit sixth in the table, nine points adrift off the Champions League qualification places but a win at Villa Park would see that difference reduced to five. United come into the game with some momentum under their belt, having won their last three in all competitions. It has been an underwhelming season for the Old Trafford faithful, who would have expected better from their side when it comes to league form. The January transfer window came and went without any new signings arriving, meaning Ten Hag will have to get a tune out of what he's already got between now and May. In contrast, Villa have enjoyed a stellar campaign so far, exceeding the expectations of just about everyone. It is Tottenham who currently occupy the much-coveted fourth spot, but a win for Emery's men would see them leapfrog Spurs into the top four. The two teams will face off at Villa Park at 4:30pm on Sunday, February 11. Last time the two teams met at Old Trafford, it was United who came away with all three points. It was a thrilling encounter, with Villa racing into a two-goal lead before a spirited second-half comeback saw United turn the game on its head and win 3-2. Rasmus Hojlund netted his first ever league goal for the club more than four months after his arrival from Atalanta. In the Premier League-era, these two teams have gone head-to-head on 57 occasions. In that spell, United have been the dominant force with 39 victories. As for Villa, they have only managed five wins in that time, with 13 draws. The game will be screened live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League. Coverage will begin on both channels at 4pm, though Sunday's first clash sees Arsenal visit West Ham and can also be watched on both of the aforementioned channels from 1pm. United have been dealt a huge blow ahead of this game, with Lisandro Martinez suffering knee ligament damage during last weekend's 3-0 win over West Ham. As a result, the Argentina international is expected to spend another eight weeks sidelined, just a month after his initial return from a lengthy lay-off. Aaron Wan-Bissaka was on the road to recovery but has suffered a minor set-back in training and will not feature. The game also comes to soon for the likes of Mason Mount, Tyrell Malacia and Anthony Martial. As for Villa, they are set to be boosted by the return of Pau Torres. The centre-back is believed to be on the verge of his first start in eight weeks. Lucas Digne is also aiming for a first run-out of 2024, but Ezri Konsa will not appear due to a sprained knee.","As for Villa, they are set to be boosted by the return of Pau Torres.

Tottenham had fallen behind to Pascal Gross' first-half penalty but were able to fashion a way back into the tie on the hour before the Welshman struck. Victory lifted the north Londoners above Aston Villa into fourth place ahead of their tough game against Manchester United on Sunday. Spurs fans were also able to welcome back skipper Son Heung-Min, following his exploits at the Asian Cup with South Korea. Here, Mail Sport takes a look at the players who shone and those thankful of the referee's final whistle.   Guglielmo Vicario Made an incredible early save to deny. He could do nothing about Gross' penalty and had precious little to do after that. 7 Pedro Porro Was his usual energic self, getting up and down the right flank. Appeared to tire as the game went on. 6 Cristian Romero Commanding and won the ball back high up the field. He defended well at the back for most of the game. 7.5 Micky van de Ven Not one of his finest days in a Spurs shirt. Lost possession which led to the Welbeck chance before giving away the penalty. Improved after the break. 6 Destiny Udogie Came off in the final 10 minutes after a disciplined display. 6 Pape Matar Sarr Showing his promise on a regular basis. He was good to start the game and only improved before scoring the equaliser. 8 Rodrigo Bentancur Started slowly and was culpable for Brighton's opener. Lasted only an hour after a sub par afternoon. 6  James Maddison Involved in a lot of Spurs' good moments. Set Richarlison up for a chance early on before playing a part in the late winner. 7 Dejan Kulusevski Another who improved as the game went on. Played the ball through to Sarr in the build-up to the equaliser. 7 Richarlison Led the line well, worked hard and ran all afternoon. Had a few shots that were either blocked or saved before playing the ball into Son, which he delivered for the winner. 7.5 Timo Werner Quiet first half that didn't really improve in the second. Final ball was inconsistent . 6.5 SUBS Son Heung-min ( for Bentancur, 62 mins) Assisted the winning goal after coming on and making a impact. A brilliant return for the South Korean. 7 Yves Bissouma (for Kulusevski, 63 mins) Looked rusty after his lay off. Improved as the game went on. 6 Brennan Johnson (for Werner, 62 mins) Fluffed his lines with a couple of attempts before making it count late on. 7  Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (for Udogie, 80 mins) Came on in place of Udogie in the final 10 mins of regular time.

The Dutchmanâs future is back under the microscope this summer, as the Blaugrana again look to slash their wage bill for second summer in a row.  De Jong, 26, is their highest earner currently, and set to earn similar next year, while his deal finishes in 2026. Desperate to see him reduce, or at least spread out his wages more, and give themselves some security over his contract situation, Barcelona have made a renewal offer that de Jong has not responded to. If he does want to stay though, they want to speed up talks. On the contrary, if de Jong is not convinced by the project or a new contract, they have made it clear he must bring in a major offer to leave this summer. They believe he is worth at least â¬100m, given Chelsea spent more than that on the likes of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez.","On the contrary, if de Jong is not convinced by the project or a new contract, they have made it clear he must bring in a major offer to leave this summer.

Erik ten Hag's side took the lead in the 17th minute through the inform Rasmus Hojlund, who sweeped the ball home from close-range. Douglas Luiz turned home Aston Villa's equaliser after 67 minutes before McTominay's powerful headers secured the win for United. The results sees United go five points behind Unai Emery's side in the race for the Champions League spots. Mail Sport's Chris Wheeler picks out some of the things you may have missed.  The McTominay impact Scott McTominay is emerging as an unlikely supersub for Manchester United this season. The Scotland midfielderâs late winner here at Villa Park was the third time he has climbed off the bench to score a crucial goal for Erik ten Hag. McTominay snatched an injury-time double to beat Brentford at Old Trafford in October, and he also came on to score at Wolves earlier this month as United emerged victorious in a 4-3 ding-dong. He is now the joint-highest scoring sub in the Premier League this season with Joao Pedro of Brighton, while his six league goals are more than in his previous three seasons put together. McTominay might not be an automatic starter but his decision to turn down a move to West Ham last summer and stay at his boyhood club has certainly paid off for Ten Hag.  In-form Hojlund Rasmus Hojlund's hot streak continues. The Daneâs opening goal at Villa Park was his sixth in seven games in all competitions for United since breaking his Premier League duck in the corresponding fixture on Boxing Day. Hojlund hasnât been able to stop scoring since then with goals against Tottenham, Newport, Wolves, West Ham and now another one against Villa, plus two assists. Unitedâs Â£72million summer signing from Atalanta is the second youngest player to score in five successive Premier League games behind Nicolas Anelka. The Frenchman was 19 years 239 days when he did it for Arsenal in 1998. Hojlund turned 21 earlier this month.  Villa fans target Fernandes Bruno Fernandes was the target for abuse from the Holte End each time he went over to take a corner in the first half. âHeâs going to cry in a minute,â was one of the kinder chants directed his way. The United captain got his own back when his set-piece led to the opening goal as Harry Maguire headed down Fernandesâ corner for Hojlund to score.  Quick catch-up Old Leicester City teammates Jonny Evans and Youri Tielemans took an opportunity to catch up shortly before half-time when the United and Villa substitutes warmed up on the touchline. Evans and Tielemans spent three-and-a-half years together at Leicester, winning the FA Cup in 2021 when Tielemans scored the only goal in the final against Chelsea, and they had a good old chinwag as the match was going on.  An unlikely pairing The knee injury that has ruled Lisandro Martinez out for eight weeks meant that Raphael Varane and Harry Maguire started a Premier League match for the first time under Erik ten Hag. United last started with this central defensive partnership in the league against Brighton in May 2022. Martinezâs absence is certainly a blow for Ten Hag and the United boss had another setback at Villa Park when Luke Shaw was forced off at half-time. Southgate watches on Gareth Southgate was back at his old club to watch this one, and no doubt the England manager kept a keen eye on Kobbie Mainoo after heaping praise on Unitedâs rising star in midweek. âHe's had a fabulous start to his career and it will be good to monitor him as we go forward,â said Southgate, and he witnessed another assured, mature performance from the teenage midfielder.  Anniversary ruined! Unai Emery's 100th Premier League game in charge wasnât lacking in entertainment, and Villa were worthy of at least a point. But after 20 wins and one defeat at Villa Park in 22 games in all competitions, they have now lost the last three at home.","But after 20 wins and one defeat at Villa Park in 22 games in all competitions, they have now lost the last three at home."

Neymar followed Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to the Saudi Pro League last summer and became Al-Hilal's marquee signing when he joined for Â£78million. However, he has made just five appearances for the club before suffering a serious knee injury while away on international duty with Brazil. The 32-year-old forward will reportedly miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery to fix the ligament in his knee. Neymar's current deal at Al-Hilal runs until 2025, but Santos are already plotting a move for the former Paris Saint-Germain forward.   Club president Marcelo Teixeira has already started talks with the 32-year-old and things are said to be progressing nicely. He said: 'The conversation [with Neymar] was very quick, but it's always quick conversations that have good effect. 'To come back and play here, he needs to recover well from injury. He will continue his experience in Saudi Arabia and then come back here.' The departure of Neymar could be mutually beneficial for him and the club given Al-Hilal are struggling for space within the squad. Al-Hilal completed the signing of Brazilian full back Renan Lodi in January but had to remove Neymar from the squad to register another overseas player. The club will be able to re-register Neymar at the end of the season when he is likely to return from injury, but his future in Saudi Arabia could now be in doubt. Al-Hilal already have a number of high-profile overseas players including Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic, and must make the call over whether Neymar warrants a place in their squad ahead of the 2024-25 season. Neymar's Al-Hilal deal is due to run until June 2025, and there is an option to extend his contract by a further year, but the two parties could go their separate ways. Therefore, Santos could be a good option for Neymar - who promised he would return to his boyhood club before hanging up his boots. Neymar burst onto the world stage at Santos in 2009 at just 17-years-old and quickly began to forge a status as one of the nation's most talented rising stars. His flair and outrageous skill caught the eye of Barcelona and from there the winger's rise to the top of world football began.   ",

Now, it appears that the Premier League sides have been informed on what De Jong's price-tag will be in the summer, ahead of a potential bidding war between the two.  According to Mundo Deportivo, the Catalan giants have placed an Â£85million (â¬100million) price-tag on the midfielder. De Jong himself recently insisted that he's 'very satisfied' at Barcelona but also refused to rule out a potential move in the future. While speaking to Dutch outlet NOS about his current situation, and when asked about a possible move to another league, he replied: 'Possibly. But I'm very satisfied at Barca. It's always difficult to say. For now I feel good here. He added: 'I am in the club where I always wanted to be, where I dreamed.' De Jong has made 16 starts for Barca this season, scoring just once - with an ankle injury keeping him out for two months of the campaign. The Dutchman came under fire last month after he was accused of feigning illness to miss Barcelona's 3-2 defeat against Antwerp, with his agent angrily dismissing the reports as 'fake news'. Catalan outlet RAC1 had suggested that the player rang Deco to inform the Barca chief of his status, but the report claims that the Portugal legend was not entirely convinced.   A summer move to United would see De Jong finally reunite with his old Ajax boss Ten Hag. The pair worked together from 2017-19, where they won the domestic double and reached a Champions League semi final in 2019. United's interest in De Jong persisted beyond their failed efforts in 2022 as they reiterated their desire to sign the midfielder last year. De Jong also reportedly told Ten Hag that he wanted to join the club. After failing to land De Jong, United spent Â£60m to acquire Casemiro from Real Madrid, however form and fitness have paved the way for his exit this summer. De Jong, who has two years remaining on his deal with the Catalan club, is also of interest to French giants PSG.","De Jong, who has two years remaining on his deal with the Catalan club, is also of interest to French giants PSG."

Hermoso is one of several players out of contract at the end of the season, and has yet to renew his deal. As per the latest enquiries into his situation, Football EspaÃ±a understood last week that he was getting closer to leaving Atletico than staying, with both sides refusing to budge on their negotiating position. Nevertheless, Cerezo has told MD that the talks are moving in the right direction. âI think everything is going its way, he is an important player for the club and I think there is not going to be any problem.â Cerezo also spoke on Kylian Mbappe, who has told Paris Saint-Germain he will leave the club at the end of the season. âMbappe is a great player and I imagine that there will be many clubs in Europe that will want him. We always like good players, the thing is that everyone has their preferences.â Hermoso has been a starter for Diego Simeone for the past year, after a spell out of the side. His ball-playing ability has been crucial to their shift in style, getting on the ball more often, and even finding Antoine Griezmann. Without him, they would not have a similar profile in their squad.","Hermoso has been a starter for Diego Simeone for the past year, after a spell out of the side.

Itâs now been 474 minutes since La Real last found the back of the net, it was Sheraldo Becker that did that when he scored their second in the 2-1 victory over Celta Vigo in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals. Since then, they have failed to score against Rayo Vallecano (0-0), Girona (0-0), Mallorca (0-0), Osasuna (0-1) and now PSG (0-2). As per MD, itâs the first time in 51 years that La Real have failed to score in five consecutive matches, having last done so between February and March in 1973. Itâs clear to see that the likes of the Andre Silva, Umar Sadiq and Takefusa Kubo need to step up. They have an opportunity to do so against Mallorca on Sunday, as Real Sociedad look to finally end this unwanted streak.","Itâs clear to see that the likes of the Andre Silva, Umar Sadiq and Takefusa Kubo need to step up.

50,"Barcelona 'have a five-man wishlist for this summer', with three PL players in",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-have-a-five-man-wishlist-for-this-summer-with-three-PL-players-in/3302152,1 day ago,"Barcelona sporting director Deco has reportedly drawn up a five-man wishlist ahead of the summer transfer window.  The Catalan giants are set to start over ahead of next season, with manager Xavi departing at the end of the current campaign. They are already putting plans in place to try and attack the transfer market to rebuild their squad. According to AS, they are interested in signing Premier League trio Gabriel Martinelli, Amadou Onana and Kaoru Mitoma, and they are also keen on Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Girona's Aleix Garcia. Martinelli may be the most surprising target on this list, given that he has become a regular in the Gunners' starting XI in recent years and has a contract with the club until 2027, with the option for a further year.   Onana has also been linked with Arsenal and Chelsea, and has demonstrated his ability to play in a holding role or further forward in midfield for Everton, making him an intriguing option for top clubs. He has a deal with the Toffees that runs until 2027, and may be difficult to prise away from Goodison Park. Brighton's Mitoma also has a long-term contract at the Amex Stadium, but could be a more realistic option as the Seagulls have been willing to sell their star players in the past. Khvaratskhelia helped Napoli win their first Serie A title in 33 years last season, but has had a quieter campaign this time around. He has still registered six goals and four assists in the league, though, and remains an exciting prospect at just 23.   Meanwhile, Garcia has been a key player in Girona's title push this season, with the Spanish side just five points behind leaders Real Madrid. Barcelona's financial issues have been well-documented, but the club appear prepared to overhaul their squad to turn their fortunes around, as they will reportedly listen to offers for Frenkie de Jong and Jules Kounde this summer. After winning LaLiga last May, they have endured a disappointing season which has seen them slip 10 points behind Madrid, lose to them 4-1 in the Super Cup final, and exit the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage. Big changes may be needed to get them back competing for major honours, and Deco seems to be ready to shake things up in the coming months.","Big changes may be needed to get them back competing for major honours, and Deco seems to be ready to shake things up in the coming months."

La Real were by far the better team in the first half, and they came closest to scoring, as Mikel Merinoâs piledriver from distance smacked the crossbar, with Gianluigi Donnarumma well beaten. PSG came out much better in the second period, and they would take the lead soon after the interval as Kylian Mbappe finished at the back post following Marquinhosâ flick-on from a corner. It was 2-0 soon after, with Bradley Barcola scoring a fine solo goal to double the advantage. It remained that way until the full time whistle. Real Sociedad arenât out of this tie, although they will need a titanic performance in the return leg at the Reale Arena, which takes place in three weeksâ time.","It remained that way until the full time whistle.

Johnson completed a comeback victory for Spurs by scoring in the 96th-minute to hand the hosts three vital Premier League points against Roberto de Zerbi's side. After firing in the stoppage time winner, Johnson ran off to the corner flag inside a bouncing Tottenham Hotspur stadium and recreated Hardy's famous hand gesture. The celebration saw the Wales international show his left-hand with his ring finger and thumb tucked away and make a gun gesture with his other hand. Speaking after full-time, Johnson revealed that Hardy was his favourite wrestling star and dedicated his celebration to him.  'And the celebration is actually, if anyone watches WWE, Jeff Hardy my favourite WWE superstar, so yeah that one's for him,' he said. Now Jeff's wrestling AEW star brother Matt Hardy has responded by sharing an image of them producing the same celebration alongside a picture of Johnson.   At just 22-years-old, Johnson, like many, grew up in an era where the high-flying acrobatics of the Hardy brothers was one of WWE's most recognisable features. Social media erupted at Hardy's response to Johnson, with the brothers now a fan of the Tottenham forward who joined the club from Nottingham Forest in the summer.

It meant that Manuel Pellegrini had one less centre-back option for the first half of the season, and it had a significant effect, as a long-term injury to Marc Bartra meant that only German Pezzella and Chadi Riad were options for Los Verdiblancos.  The situation has since improved, with Sokratis having joined, but Betis could now repeat the trick of selling an important first team player after the transfer window has closed â this time, itâs Willian Jose. The 32-year-old has been elevated to Betisâ starting striker this season, as he is their top scorer with 11 goals across all competitions. However, Estadio Deportivo report that Palmeiras are considering making an offer for him, as they look to prepare for the exit of Endrick Felipe to Real Madrid in the summer. Real Betis are well covered in the striker department at the moment, with Chimy Avila, Cedric Bakambu and Nabil Fekir as options alongside Willian Jose. Still, it would now be wise to sell him, as the situation from earlier in the season shows that anything can happen in terms of injuries.","Real Betis are well covered in the striker department at the moment, with Chimy Avila, Cedric Bakambu and Nabil Fekir as options alongside Willian Jose.

After Kylian Mbappe took the decisive step, one that it appears he cannot row back on, of telling Paris Saint-Germain CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi that he would be leaving at the end of his contract, Real Madrid are poised to move in. While there have been reports that Los Blancos will put together a deal for Mbappe now, Matteo MorettoÂ  has revealed to The Daily Briefing that the deal is close.  Mbappe communicated his decision to PSG on Tuesday, who in turn confirmed the news to the media with a circular on Thursday. Some reports have claimed that Real Madrid President Florentino Perez would not enter into talks with Mbappe until he had made his decision clear to Mbappe, but Moretto says a deal is lacking only a few small loose ends before Mbappe can sign on the dotted line. While few will allow themselves to pop the champagne ahead of time, having been burnt beforehand, it certainly appears as if Carlo Ancelotti can start making plans for his forward line with the Frenchman in place for next season. Real Madrid first started pursuing Mbappe as a teenager in the Monaco academy, at the age of 13. Nearly 13 years later, after turning down Perez on three occasions, Mbappe looks set to pull on the white of Real Madrid. Image via Afp7 / Europa Press",Image via Afp7 / Europa Press

It was an excellent victory for Pep Guardiola's side with Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden all getting on the scoresheet to seal a 3-1 victory. City have now claimed 11 consecutive wins on the bounce and despite Magnus Mattsson finding an equaliser after De Bruyne had put the visitors up inside the 10th minute, it was a professional performance from the Cityzens infront of a raucaus home crowd. Despite that, they were dealt a tough blow in the first-half, after Jack Grealish appeared to sustain a muscle injury, with the City forward leaving the field visibly distraught having struggled for game time in recent weeks. Mail Sport's Jack Gaughn rates Man City's players following their victory.   Uncharacteristic mistake for Copenhagenâs goal, gifting away possession. Didnât have much to do either side of that. Elias Achouri is the Copenhagen danger man but was barely given a sniff by Cityâs captain. Back home in central midfield in possession and classily eased his way through the game.   Viktor Claesson was not always easy to pick up in the false nine role but Dias got his basics right. Not the best night when on the ball, although defended well with one notably strong header to avert danger. Just there, in the way, at all times. Copenhagen werenât allowed to break from midfield that often and it was down to him. Best player on the park once again. Keeps going through the gears. Industrious in his running as well as quality around the box. Deserved his goal.   Brilliant dinked finish to put City back in front. Operated in a number of different positions. Slowed the game down when required. The comeback continues to amaze. Another goal, a super passed strike, and heâs looking as menacing as ever at the moment. Forced off with an injury early doors after showing some nice touches as City dominated the opening exchanges.   Struggled to really get into the game yet then impacted it heavily when involved.

'I'm looking at the Champions League thinking who could stop City â and I'm thinking probably Arsenal. If they met each other, we know that City would be massive favourites,' he added. Arsenal have been knocked out at the competition's current stage on the last seven occasions they have featured in the Champions League.   Previous to that they made it to the quarter-finals in the 2007/09 and 2009/10 seasons, while going to the semi-finals during the year in between. There only appearance in the final came in the 2005/06 campaign when Arsene Wenger's side were beaten 2-1 by Barcelona. Real Madrid have one foot in the next round after beating RB Leipzig 1-0 in the first-leg of their last-16 tie and Carragher warned the tournament record holders could prove too much for the Gunners. 'If Arsenal played Real Madrid, who are a top side and still have a decent team, psychologically being in the Champions League could stop Arsenal because they haven't been there. But I think Arsenal have a decent chance,' he added.","'If Arsenal played Real Madrid, who are a top side and still have a decent team, psychologically being in the Champions League could stop Arsenal because they haven't been there.

63,Barcelona reconsidering options with forward due to Xavi Hernandez exit,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-reconsidering-options-with-forward-due-to-Xavi-Hernandez-exit/3302589,19 hours ago,"Barcelona are already setting out some of their plans for the coming season between the Board of Directors, Sporting Director Deco and President Joan Laporta. However Xavi Hernandezâs departure could see a swing in the future of some of their players.  Already it has been reported that Sergi Roberto may become a victim of Xaviâs departure, with his contract due to expire at the end of the season. The opposite could be the case for Ansu Fati say Sport, with the forward due to return from his loan move at Brighton. Xavi appeared to have lost faith in Fati, and that played a key part in him heading to England in order to try and improve his fortunes. With Xavi still there, Ansu seemed likely to exit this summer, either on loan or permanently, in the knowledge that he woud probably play a secondary role. However a change of manager might see the 21-year-old get another shot. Injuries have again kept him again this year at Brighton, where he has missed several months of action again. He has been relatively dangerous during the games he has played, appearing 19 times, scoring on four occasions and giving one assist. On average though, he has contributed to a goal every 140 minutes.","Injuries have again kept him again this year at Brighton, where he has missed several months of action again.

64,Man Utd could call in Kenyan marathon runners & rugby stars to speak to players,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-Utd-could-call-in-Kenyan-marathon-runners--rugby-stars-to-speak-to-players/3302255,17 hours ago,"Kenyan  marathon runners and All Blacks rugby stars may be drafted in to speak to Manchester Unitedâs players as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS seek to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.  In a wide-ranging special report ahead of next weekâs expected confirmation of the petrochemical billionaireâs 25 per cent stake in his boyhood club, Mail Sport can also reveal: Insiders say INEOS are keen to use expertise from their stable of interests in other sports, including running, rugby and Formula One. Ratcliffeâs firm are performance partners with the New Zealanders and medics from the All Blacks camp have already worked with Nice, the Ligue 1 club he owns in France.   In recent times marathon runners from the INOES-backed NN group have also given talks to All Blacks players on mentality and endurance. The prospect of both heading to the clubâs Carrington base at some point is thought to be likely. Meanwhile, with a move for Newcastleâs Dan Ashworth to become sporting director expected over the coming days, United are also considering an approach for Southampton director of football Jason Wilcox. Under the guidance of Ratcliffe's right-hand-man Sir Dave Brailsford, a visit from the All Blacks and Kenya's best long-distance runners at United's Carrington training complex is a realistic possibility. Brailsford has harnessed his 'marginal gains' philosophy in other sporting ventures and when Eliud Kipchoge, from the INEOS-backed NN professional running group, broke the marathon world record and went sub two hours in 2019 he did so on the back of aerodynamic advice from those within INEOSâS sailing (INEOS Britannia) and motor racing (Mercedes-AMG F1) ventures. At INEOS-owned Ligue 1 side, Nice, Kenyan running coaches have been introduced to give tips to players on pace explosions and being quicker off the mark. Similarly, when wing-backs at the French club began to suffer from a muscle problem more common with the stop-start nature of rugby than football, medical experts from the All Blacks were brought in to assist in treatment and prevention.    Kenyan marathon runners have also given talks to the New Zealanders on mental endurance. 59-year-old Brailsford is at the heart of this after making a career on the back of his marginal gains philosophy, most notably at Team Sky and British Cycling. Sir Alex Ferguson previously visited the Manchester Velodrome HQ, later dubbed âthe gold medal factoryâ, and on a later trip discussed with Brailsford how to ensure all within a team were committed to the common goal. Ferguson leant over and delivered a typically blunt line in his native Glaswegian tones. âDave,â he said. Itâs simple - just get rid of the c****â.","Ferguson leant over and delivered a typically blunt line in his native Glaswegian tones. âDave,â he said.

65,Forgotten Arsenal prodigy reveals injury ordeal kept him sidelined for 400+ days,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Forgotten-Arsenal-prodigy-reveals-injury-ordeal-kept-him-sidelined-for-400%2B-days/3299286,11 Feb,"Former Arsenal prospect Gedion Zelalem has opened up on the injury woes that sidelined him for more than 400 days.  And the midfielder, who is now playing for Den Bosch , believes he would have made a full breakthrough with the Gunners had he not ruptured his ACL. In an interview with the Athletic, Zelalem said it was âhard to takeâ as he struggled to make a full recovery from the injury and he was nowhere his best fitness level for âtwo or three years.â But the 27-year-old says he now feels like himself again as he seeks to keep Den Bosch in the second tier of Dutch football. âI still think if I hadnât got my anterior cruciate ligament injury, things would have gone differently at Arsenal, even though I had stagnated and gone out on loan,â Zelalem said. âI was out for six months, but then I needed another surgery and was out for over 400 days. The worst part was I was nowhere near myself for two or three years. âNot being as nimble as I was was hard to take because I was always one of the best players on my team. To go from that to not being that guy was really difficult. âI never got rhythm and playing time, so I could never truly get match fit. On the outside looking in, people may not have seen much of a difference, but as a player you know your body and how you used to play. âItâs only been in the last two years that Iâve truly felt like myself again.â Zelalem, who was born in Germany, arrived at Arsenal as a teenager after being spotted by scouts while playing in the United States. He was compared to Cesc Fabregas in terms of playing style and Arsene Wenger brought him on a first-team pre-season tour of Asia in 2013. He made his senior debut as a substitute in an FA Cup game against Coventry City in January 2014, a couple of days before his 17th birthday, and subsequently went on loan to Rangers and VVV-Venlo before suffering the injury in 2017. And Zelalem was also impacted by personal tragedy - the death of his sister in a car accident in the summer of 2018. âFreddie Ljungberg [then Arsenal Under-23s head coach] told me I had come back really well from the ACL in my first four weeks of pre-season. Then the accident happened while she was in Ethiopia and I was in London for pre-season, which was a really tough moment. âI was in Ethiopia for a couple of weeks with family and I came back not me at all. I wasnât there physically or mentally.â He went on to join Sporting Kansas City in early 2019 and has also had a spell with New York City FC.",He went on to join Sporting Kansas City in early 2019 and has also had a spell with New York City FC.

Brahim Diaz was the matchwinner, although it was Andriy Lunin that proved to be the real hero, as he made nine saves on his way to a well-earned clean sheet.  Brahim spoke to the media after the match (via Diario AS), and he described his winning goal, which has been called Messi-esque by many spectators. âI get the ball, I make the first feint, I see that they are afraid to go in for the tackle, they retreat a lotâ¦ And thatâs where I put it in the top corner. I saw Vini and wanted to give it to him, I hesitated, but I ended up shooting. It was a nice goal.â Brahim was forced off towards the end of the match after suffering a calf injury. He provided an update on the situation. âHonestly, right now I donât know, Iâm not going to lie to you. Iâve noticed a blow and I donât know if the soleus went up or what happened. I guess tomorrow Iâll get tested and hope that it wonât be anything.â Real Madrid will desperately hope that Brahim is okay, especially considering that he is the replacement for Jude Bellingham, who is currently out injured himself. The injury problems continue to pile up for Carlo Ancelotti.","Real Madrid will desperately hope that Brahim is okay, especially considering that he is the replacement for Jude Bellingham, who is currently out injured himself.

A much-rotated Les Parisiens were able to get the job done despite the absence of their star man in attack. However, this has raised doubts over the 25-year-oldâs availability for PSGâs upcoming Champions League clash against Real Sociedad.  In the aftermath of PSGâs victory against Lille, Luis Enrique was quizzed on the availability of his attacker for their upcoming Champions League round of 16 tie against Sociedad. In quotes captured by RMC, the PSG manager responded, âKylian is fine, but we didnât want to take any risks. If it was a final, he would have played, but he will be 100% ready on Wednesday.â MbappÃ© was only available for the bench against Lille due to an ankle injury he suffered after a challenge from Lillian Brassier (24) against Brest.

68,"8 times football celebrations backfired: Douglas Luiz vs Man Utd, Richarlison...",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/8-times-football-celebrations-backfired-Douglas-Luiz-vs-Man-Utd-Richarlison.../3301633,2 days ago,"ALAN SHEARER kept things simple.  Douglas Luiz's chest shimmy against Manchester United backfired on him The Premier League's record goalscorer celebrated each of his 260 Prem goals with a hand held aloft. But it seems that not only have celebrations grown increasingly complex, but have taken on a whole new dimension of trolling between teams. Douglas Luiz stole the headlines on Sunday as he stooped to his knees and ""shoulder-shimmied"" in front of Manchester United keeper Andre Onana after scoring Villa's equaliser - only for United to get a winner and have the last laugh. And before that, there was dart-gate when Neal Maupay took James Maddison's signature darts celebration. Here's a look at eight times football celebrations have gone wrong...  The latest in the list of a growing genre - the troll celebration. Luiz struck to cancel out Rasmus Hojlund's opener and immediately stooped to his knees and shook his shoulders back and forth in front of Onana. But the celebration went on to blow up in his face, with Villa going on to lose the game 2-1 courtesy of a late Scott McTominay winner. FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS & NEW CUSTOMER BONUSES United legend Rio Ferdinand took a swipe at Luiz after the game, writing on X: ""U ok @dgoficial?""  But the midfielder has since responded to explain his celebration, saying: ""I'm good, thanks. It's just carnival time in Brazil."" The Biggest January Flop Signings In Premier League History  Maupay nicking James Maddison's celebration introduced a derby atmosphere between Tottenham and Brentford which had never existed before. After scoring the opener in the 15th minute, Maupay mocked Maddison's signature darts-throwing celebration, with Ivan Toney joining in as well. The decision to do so riled Tottenham's players, with Maddison and Maupay having a physical altercation 15 minutes later. Maupay's celebration came back to bite him, with Brennan Johnson and Richarlison celebrating their goals with darts-throwing celebrations in response to the Bees striker. The entire Spurs team had the last laugh as they went on to win the game 3-2.   Richarlison (various) 2022-23 season Tottenham's second season under Antonio Conte was one to forget for players and fans alike - but none more so than for Richarlison. The Brazilian signed from Everton for Â£60million but managed just one Premier League goal - as it became clear Conte did not fancy him. Fellow forwards Michail Antonio and Callum Wilson poked fun at the forward for the fact that he had received more bookings for taking his shirt off than scored goals that season. His sole Premier League goal came when he equalised late on against Liverpool to make it 3-3 in April 2023. Richarlison celebrated by taking his shirt off before breaking into his pigeon celebration - and was duly booked. Unfortunately for the forward, Liverpool instantly went up the other end to score a 94th minute 4-3 winner through Diogo Jota. Richarlison has been a success this season under Postecoglou, however, with ten goals in 21 Premier League games - more than Wilson and Antonio combined.  It was a painful celebration for Paraguayan winger Sosa last week, who plays for Argentine side Talleres. The player said he was trying to emulate the knee slides commonly seen in the Premier League, but perhaps should have thought more about attempting it on a dry pitch in the height of the Argentine summer. Sosa's knees got stuck in the turf and he collapsed in pain.   The main thing about this celebration is that Batshuayi didn't actually score. He was so excited to see winger Adnan Januzaj curl one past Jordan Pickford that he picked the ball up and tried to boot it into the net. But the forward managed to miss the goal and boot it at the post, before it ricocheted back into his face - spawning a tonne of memes.   The Brazilian striker was making his debut for Consadole in the J-League and wanted to jump into the stands to celebrate with his new fans by hopping the advertising hoardings. Unfortunately though, there was a huge drop between the fans and the pitch rather than an athletics track - and Lopes required medical treatment. Despite this, he went on to score another three goals.    Morrow should have had a dream day having scored Arsenal's winner against Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup final. But, in the ensuing celebrations after the game, he was picked up by captain Tony Adams. Adams lost his footing, though, and his slip sent Morrow crashing to the ground. The player's fall saw him break his arm, meaning he missed not only the medal ceremony for the Gunners, but their FA Cup final a month later.   Diogo was playing for Swiss side Servette when he set up a late winner for former Wigan full-back Jean Beausejour in the 87th minute of the game. In the celebrations, he climbed the fencing separating fans from the pitch but got his wedding ring caught in the wiring. When Diogo dropped down from the fence, his finger, and his wedding ring, remained. The player did not initially realise he had lost a finger and was even booked by the ref for over-celebrating.  After realising what had happened, Diogo dropped to the floor in agony. Despite the best efforts of doctors at a Zurich hospital, Diogo's finger could not be reattached - although he did manage to continue his playing career with just the nine digits. ",
69,Crystal Palace are 'considering Cooper & Southgate' as Roy Hodgson replacements,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Crystal-Palace-are-considering-Cooper--Southgate-as-Roy-Hodgson-replacements/3299255,11 Feb,"Crystal Palace have identified former Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper and England manager Gareth Southgate as potential long-term replacements for Roy Hodgson, according to reports.  76-year-old Hodgson has endured a difficult season in the dugout that started brightly, but has since faded with Palace dropping to within five-points of the relegation zone with recent thrashings against Arsenal and Brighton. A victory against Chelsea at Selhurst Park on Monday evening would alleviate some of the discontent from sections over the club fanbase who want to see Hodgson replaced and Palace have began identifying potential successors, as reported by The Sun. Cooper has been out of work since being sacked by Nottingham Forest in December and replaced by ex-Wolves and Tottenham head coach Nuno Espirito Santo. However, he is expected to remain in the Premier League and is a viable long-term option being considered at Palace, with the club wanting to avoid bringing in another manager for only a short amount of time.   The 44-year-old is admired by Palace chairman Steve Parish, although the club would prefer to wait until the summer to bring in a new head coach rather than midway through the season. England manager Southgate is also under consideration, but is viewed as a more unrealistic appointment given his commitment to the national team. He could become available following this year's European Championship in Germany and has previously been touted for a stint at a Premier League side with his only other club management experience coming at Middlesbrough. However, the FA are keen to try and extend his stay in charge of the Three Lions regardless of England's performance in the upcoming major tournament. Palace have also held long-standing interest in Portuguese head coach Paulo Fonseca and were previously interested in bringing him to Selhurst Park.   Fonseca is currently in charge of French side Lille after joining two-years-ago and has been tipped to leave the team at the end of the season if a Premier League vacancy comes to fruition. Meanwhile, Palace supporters are likely to vent their frustration again on Monday evening as calls continue to grow for an immediate change in the dugout. Hodgson returned to Palace last season and completed his task of steering the club away from relegation, doing so in impressive style. However, there has been public frustration from sections of the team's fanbase this campaign after Hodgson extended his stay at the club in the summer for the current season.","However, there has been public frustration from sections of the team's fanbase this campaign after Hodgson extended his stay at the club in the summer for the current season."

Everyone's favourite club competition has reached the knockout rounds and the last-16 ties get underway this week.  Manchester City continue their title defence against FC Copenhagen, who have already dumped out their neighbours United this season. Arsenal have been handed what appears a pretty favourable draw against Porto as they look to go deeper, while Real Madrid - desperate to win a 15th title - will take on RB Leipzig. Napoli vs Barcelona is the 'Diego Maradona derby' and PSV Eindhoven vs Borussia Dortmund counts as the hipsters' choice. Inter Milan's tie against Atletico Madrid will be well worth watching, while Bayern Munich face a tricky assignment against Lazio, and Paris Saint-Germain continue their mission to finally lift the famous trophy against Real Sociedad. Ahead of the last-16, we pick out a few players you might want to keep an eye on. ROONY BARDGHJI FC Copenhagen Remember the name? Manchester United certainly did when Roony's late goal settled a seven-goal thriller in Copenhagen's favour during the group stages. Now the Kuwait-born Sweden under-21 international, just 18, is hoping to claim the scalp of Manchester City in what would amount to a seismic shock. The teenager has been nicknamed the 'Swedish Messi' and has the raw ability to hurt City if they're not careful. Bardghji has gone public with his ambition to play for Real Madrid one day but a number of top European clubs - United included - are watching his progress closely.  LOIS OPENDA RB Leipzig While Real will be strong favourites to beat a Leipzig side well off the pace in the Bundesliga, they will be wary of Belgian forward Openda, who is enjoying an outstanding season. He scored four goals in the group stage - three of those coming against Man City - and has 19 altogether this season. His 15 in the league is behind only Harry Kane and Stuttgart's Serhou Guirassy. Openda, 23, did cost Leipzig Â£33million when they signed him from Lens last summer but he's already proving excellent value for money.  MARTIN ZUBIMENDI Real Sociedad PSG vs Sociedad may have the appearance of a David vs Goliath clash but the LaLiga side have personnel that should cause a few problems. Zubimendi has been described as the new Sergio Busquets for his ability to control the tempo of a match from midfield. Reports suggest Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta likes the look of the 25-year-old as a replacement for Thomas Partey.  LUUK DE JONG PSV Eindhoven De Jong is hardly a fresh face but you'd be hard pressed to find a more in-form player than the PSV striker and captain heading into the last-16. He has nine goals in his last eight outings in all competitions and is especially adept when it comes to headed goals, with 12 of his 26 this season coming aerially. Dortmund have looked susceptible defensively at times this season and PSV, who have a commanding 10 point lead at the top of the Eredivisie, will fancy their chances as underdogs.  PEPE Porto Not that Pepe requires any introduction it's more that many fans will be astonished he's still going strong. The Porto defender will be 41 by the conclusion of their tie with Arsenal and while niggly injuries ensure he's in and out of their side, he does appear regularly in the Champions League - a trophy he's lifted three times. If fit, he'll relish the opportunity to rile up Arsenal but needs to know when to rein it in. Pepe was sent off for the 16th time in his career against Sporting Lisbon back in December for throwing an arm into an opponent's face.  HAKAN CALHANOGLU Inter Milan Barely a week has passed this season without Calhanoglu making the headlines and the Turkish international is regarded as Serie A's best midfielder by many. Not only does he score goals - 11 this season - but his defence-splitting passes deserve a highlights reel of their own. In the recent 1-0 win over Juventus, Calhanoglu played one outrageous pass with the precision of a golfer chipping onto the green.  JAMIE BYNOE-GITTENS Borussia Dortmund Dortmund may have added Jadon Sancho into their Champions League squad ahead of playing PSV but he's not their only English winger. Bynoe-Gittens, 19, has been starting more and more games for Edin Terzic's side as the season has progressed and has already faced the likes of PSG and AC Milan in the competition. He impresses in one-on-one situations in wide areas and has an end product, with two goals and six assists this season.   ARTHUR VERMEEREN Atletico Madrid It was partly the Belgian teenager's Champions League performances - including a goal in a 3-2 win over Barcelona - that persuaded Atletico Madrid to sign Vermeeren last month. Regarded as one of the brightest up-and-coming talents in the game, Vermeeren, 19, will surely have some involvement in the tie with Inter Milan. He picked the Spanish club for the next stage of his development having been linked to Arsenal, Tottenham and Man United.","He picked the Spanish club for the next stage of his development having been linked to Arsenal, Tottenham and Man United."

They are Inigo Martinez, Vitor Roque and Gavi â the former pair both joined the club this season (Martinez last summer, Roque in January), while for Gavi, he has been temporarily registered with La Liga, as a result of issues in regards to his registration last season.  Gavi was registered as a first team player last January, which saw him handed the number six jersey, although a court order later annulled this, meaning that Barcelona were racing against time to ensure that the teenage midfielder couldnât leave at the end of last season as a free agent. They managed to do it, but could only secure his registration on a temporary basis, until the end of this season. Fortunately, RAC1 have now reported that Barcelona have reached an agreement with La Liga to finalise Gaviâs registration on a permanent basis. It means that he will remain as a first team player until at least 2026, when his current contract expires. It is brilliant news for Barcelona that they have been able to sort this, and before the summer too. Gavi is a crucial player, and his absence has been significant felt since he tore his ACL back in November.","It is brilliant news for Barcelona that they have been able to sort this, and before the summer too.

75,"63 days since last competitive fixture, Copenhagen are hungry for Man City scalp",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/63-days-since-last-competitive-fixture-Copenhagen-are-hungry-for-Man-City-scalp/3301124,13 Feb,"It must feel refreshing for Manchester City that even now, even after winning the lot, they meet some uncharted water in a capital renowned for its mermaid.  Copenhagen canât really decide whether 63 days off is a good or bad thing before their biggest Champions League tie in well over a decade. While Jacob Neestrupâs side have endured a long winter break in Denmark, feet up in the snow, his opposite number Pep Guardiola and his team negotiated a dozen fixtures, including a trip to Saudi Arabia before Christmas. Neestrup maintained this is a disadvantage. Some of his players think otherwise and it will be interesting to see how they react after a friendly tournament in Portugal against other Scandinavian sides in which they played three times in five days last week. If City donât know whatâs coming in the Danish capital, they will quickly find out when this last-16 first leg kicks off in the feverish Parken tonight. Ten-man Manchester United buckled here in November when the late winner by Roony Bardghji â named after Wayne â was a result of Erik ten Hagâs team finding themselves overwhelmed by the crowd. The national stadium, a compact box with offices in one corner, comes alive under lights and staff were busy tying up the tifo in the stands last night. âImagine this stadium after two months without a game â everyone is desperate to watch football,â Guardiola said.  âI have huge respect for them. I said to the players this morning that they have to prepare mentally. The game plan will be what it has always been but they have to be ready to suffer mentally. Tomorrow will be a tight game. I feel it and normally my gut doesnât lie to me.â The Danish champions have lost only three times at home in this competition: to Chelsea in the 2011 knockouts, Real Madrid in 2013 and Bayern Munich earlier in this yearâs group. They nicked a point off Guardiolaâs Barcelona in 2010 and City during last seasonâs group stage, too. âParken is something special internationally and now we have a history,â said Neestrup, the 35-year-old coach. âParken is up there. It can carry us forward. We have faced big power before and we have a belief in ourselves and in Parken. I really donât care how good City are. Mini-Copenhagen have created big results.â So that brings us to attitude, to body language. Cityâs stars were rebuked by their boss during half-time of Saturdayâs win over Everton. With his side goalless at that point, Guardiola saw the sort of frustration from some that he will not abide. Erling Haaland bailed them out by scoring twice although he failed to escape criticism, either. Guardiola wanted him to retain a more positive outlook, even when the goals were not flowing. Fortunately for Haaland, they do flow â 73 in sky blue now. Seventeen of those are in this competition. The local media in this part of the world peppered Guardiola with an inquisition about the phenomenon. âYou see his numbers at his age,â Guardiola said. âIn the Champions League not even Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo had these numbers at his age. The numbers are unbelievable. He scores goals everywhere. âIn the first half on Saturday maybe we didnât have the special delivery players, like Kevin De Bruyne for example, who can find him. In that moment, because he is so young, in that moment he has to be positive. It will come. We never put pressure on him: âYou have to score a goal for usâ. No. Be involved with what we have to do and the rest will come naturally.   âWhen he scored, he reacted but he doesnât need to score because he helps us with many things. Not just goals. He is defined by goals but it is not just that. In many games itâs how he is clapping, encouraging his mates and the first intense press. This is what we need from Erling. Heâs a huge competitor who wants to score goals. OK, I know that, we know that, so relax. âIf we donât score today or if he doesnât score in 10 minutes, itâs OK but in the process he has to try to be, âLetâs goâ, because the team always win when they overcome bad moments.â There have been a few messages sent by Guardiola in recent weeks and the body language is only the latest as City narrow their eyes before the long annual run-up. And it is not just focused on Haaland. They all copped it a few days ago. That, you suspect, was with this Copenhagen tie in mind. âThere will be moments when we suffer,â said Guardiola. âIn these moments will we be sad and depressed or react? We have to understand that the opponents deserve to have good moments, not just us because we are champions. How you handle those moments is what defines a big team. Body language is everything in life.â","âThere will be moments when we suffer,â said Guardiola. âIn these moments will we be sad and depressed or react?

But he insists Fede Chiesa should be persevered with. Moggi, reflecting on defeat to Udinese, told Radio Bianconera: ""Was the team not properly motivated? When I saw the team circulating the ball slowly, I thought that the team was convinced of winning. Juve found themselves in difficulty and not managed to overturn the resul. ""If I would have gone down to the locker room at the end of the first half to encourage the team? I would have moved before the team kicked off... "" He continued: ""No one snubs the matches, but there are matches that are faced with more calm and this is wrong. Regardless of how it went against Udinese, Juventus' objectives are to gain qualification for the next Champions League League and the victory of the Italian Cup. If they succeed, it can be safely said that the Bianconeri will have done more than they were entitled to. ""Inter will win the Scudetto and the demonstration was given in the match against Roma, in which they annihilated the opponent of the day."" On rebuilding Juve, Moggi also said: ""For a long time, we were superior to many. Juventus has totaled twelve years of victories. But there are cycles and, sometimes, also opponents who want to win and who they have more conditions to do so. ""How to plan the future? Anticipating the times, first analysing the squad available. I, for example, when I was at Juventus I sold (Roberto) Baggio, who was a champion who wasn't totally functional for the team. ""Chiesa? If he had played as he did in the last few games, with me he would have been recalled a long time ago... But, at the same time, it must be said that he comes from a serious accident. And just as we waited for Del Piero for two years, the same should be done with him.""","""Chiesa?

77,Bayern Munich could decide next Barcelona manager,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Bayern-Munich-could-decide-next-Barcelona-manager/3302770,11 hours ago,"Barcelona will have a new manager at the start of the 2024/25 season with Bayern Munich potentially following suit.  Xavi Hernandez will leave Barcelona at the end of the current campaign with the race on to replace the former Spanish international. Barcelona do have some breathing space to bring in Xaviâs successor and the situation at Bayern could have a key impact on their plans.  The Bundesliga giants are currently considering a move to sack head coach Thomas Tuchel with former boss Hansi Flick on the list of potential replacements. As per the latest update from Bild, that would put them on a collision course with Barcelona, who are also considering Flick to succeed Xavi. Flick is keen to return to club management, following a spell in charge of the German national team, and both clubs are interested in his services. The 58-year-old is amongst the current favourites to take charge in Catalonia but a chance to return to Bavaria would be a major road block.",The 58-year-old is amongst the current favourites to take charge in Catalonia but a chance to return to Bavaria would be a major road block.

Milan face Ligue 1 side Rennes in the first leg at the San Siro Stadium after finishing third in their Champions League group. The Rossoneri lost out on goal difference to second-placed Paris St Germain despite a 3-2 win at Newcastle in their final match. AC Milan made Champions League group-stage exit despite winning at St James  Pioli told a press conference: âWe go again from the disappointment in Newcastle and weâre focusing all of our energy on the Europa League. âWe know that you need to be at your very best in Europe and thatâs what we want to do (on Thursday night). âThere are some good teams in this competition. We have to be ambitious, but we canât look too far into the future. The tie will be decided in a week and this game is a huge one.â Milan are currently third in the Serie A title race, one point behind Juventus and eight adrift of leaders Inter Milan. Pioliâs side have dropped only two points in their last five league games and have lost only one of their previous 12 games in all competitions âWe need to look at both tournaments,â added Pioli, who hinted at making changes amid a heavy fixture schedule and after Sundayâs 1-0 home win against Napoli. âI know where we want to finish in the league in terms of points and I know how far we want to go in Europe. âI hope to play a lot from here until the end. All of the players will be involved because, for example, with five games in 15 days, it would be tough for a lot of them to play the full 90 in all of those. âMaking choices and excluding players is always difficult, but itâs also true that I know that I have players coming off the bench who can change a game.â Netherlands midfielder Tijjani Reijnders is hoping to return to the starting line-up after missing out at the weekend through suspension.

There has been strong speculation in regards to several candidates, although nothing is concrete for now, as Sporting Director Deco aims to take his time.  At this stage, Hansi Flick appears to be a frontrunner for the role, but heâs not the only German manager that fancies taking over at Barcelona. According to MD, Thomas Tuchelâs entourage has offered him to the Catalan giants to be their next manager. Tuchel is currently in charge at Bayern Munich, although he is severely under pressure following last weekendâs 3-0 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen â a result that means they are five points off the lead in the Bundesliga. Tuchel is aware that his future at Bayern is far from certain, so he could now look to take the Barcelona job, provided that he is selected as a possible candidate. Itâs no surprise that Tuchel is interested in the Barcelona job. He has spoken in the past about his desire to manage one of the Clasico sides, and he could end up getting his wish this summer, although itâs too soon to say whether that will be the case.","Itâs no surprise that Tuchel is interested in the Barcelona job.

The medical visits (having been booked at CONI for today) have been postponed: the flight from Porto has also been cancelled, probably to avoid media hype, reports TMW. The medical will be re-organised soon and the deal is absolutely not in doubt: simply the Nerazzurri, in the midst of a competitive season, have preferred not to place excessive emphasis on a negotiation involving a player returning from the Asian Cup and who remains committed to Porto for the remainder of the season. Unlike Taremi, Piotr Zielinski underwent his medical yesterday, in great secrecy. The midfielder, who will arrive from Napoli in a Bosman transfer, given the expiration of his contract on June 30, will be able to sign his new deal with the Nerazzurri from July 1. Meanwhile, Iran striker Taremi will sign a two-year contract with an option for a third year in favour of the Nerazzurri club.

81,2023-24 Champions League campaign promises to heighten Premier League-LaLiga debate,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/2023-24-Champions-League-campaign-promises-to-heighten-Premier-League-LaLiga-debate/3301362,14 Feb,"With the 2023-24 Champions League knockout stages getting underway on Tuesday, with Real Madrid among those in action, there is sure to be a big focus on European footballâs premier competition.  The Premier League is represented by Manchester City and Arsenal, with the former â who you can see in action later this month if you purchase Man City v Chelsea Tickets â expected to be in the running. On the other hand, La Liga â often the league most compared with the English top flight â have four representatives: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad. With this in mind, Spain does have a better chance of winning the competition â doubly, to be exact. However, itâs expected that Man City and Real Madrid will go far, as they are two of the favourites to win the tournament. They may even end up facing each other, something they have done in the semi-final stage of the previous two editions. While these two have big chances to win their second and 15th titles respectively, the other teams aforementioned should not be counted out. For Arsenal, they have started 2024 in fine style, and will pose a threat to many of the teams still in the competition. Mikel Artetaâs side are young and hungry, and they should be underestimated despite their lack of European experience in recent years. La Liga has three other teams that could go far too. Barcelonaâs only realistic chance of winning a trophy is in the Champions League, given that they lost in the Spanish Super Cup, are out of the Copa del Rey, and are 10 points adrift of Real Madrid in the La Liga title race. Xavi Hernandez would dearly love to end his time in charge with the most coveted prize in European football, although his side need to fix their problems before this can become a realistic possibility. For Atletico, they are more than capable of reaching the later stages of the competition, as they did in 2013-14 and 2015-16. Diego Simeoneâs side face a very tough test against Serie A leaders Inter Milan, although their ability to grind out results in Europe would come in very handy on this occasion. Los Rojiblancos certainly have the pedigree to go far. Real Sociedad have the trickiest test in the last 16, as they face French champions Paris Saint-Germain. However, they â as with any other team â would dread coming to the Reale Arena, so Imanol Alguacil and his players can use that to give themselves an excellent opportunity to continue their Champions League fairytale.","Real Sociedad have the trickiest test in the last 16, as they face French champions Paris Saint-Germain.

Mauricio Pochettino's side went behind to a Jefferson Lerma goal in the first half of the London derby on Monday night before Conor Gallagher's brace and one from Enzo Fernandez snatched all three points. Ex-Eagles star Gallagher sparked wild celebrations when he calmly slotted past Dean Henderson in the first minute of stoppage time, leading to jubilant scenes between players and supporters. So ferocious were the celebrations that an advertising board in front of the away fans gave way as Chelsea players rejoiced with their travelling supporters. And the reaction of Disasi was perhaps the most extraordinary as he climbed over the barrier before launching himself, back first, on top of several fans that had encroached to join their team.  The French defender was ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts and almost immediately returned to his feet, having found no fan able to support his weight. He was booked for his actions which appeared to at least contribute to the destruction of the board. Still, it was a crucial moment for the squad and a welcome source of joy in a season that has been marked by inconsistency. The win ensured that Chelsea registered their second impressive away win in as many games after thumping Aston Villa 3-1 at Villa Park in the FA Cup last week. Before that, Pochettino's job had come under some pressure following back-to-back Premier League defeats to Liverpool and Wolves, with the latter drawing particular consternation from fans and pundits. Chelsea moved back into the top half, above Gary O'Neil's side, and are now just two points behind Newcastle in seventh.  However, the gap to the top six remains a sizeable seven, with their best hope of European football next season appearing to be via a triumph in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool at the end of the month. The Stamford Bridge outfit must first navigate the daunting task of a trip to Manchester City on Saturday, with Pep Guardiola's side looking at their annual seasonal best.","The Stamford Bridge outfit must first navigate the daunting task of a trip to Manchester City on Saturday, with Pep Guardiola's side looking at their annual seasonal best."

Exploited by Vinicius Junior, Couto has nevertheless been one of the best in Spain this season, and will return to Manchester City at the end of his loan deal in the summer. However it might not be a permanent return.  The 21-year-old is currently in the final stretch of a two-year loan at Girona, which has seen him earn a call-up to the Brazilian national team this season. One of the most creative wide players in La Liga this season, the links to Los Blancos will have been no surprise to regular watchers. According to Matteo Moretto, as revealed on The Daily Briefing, Manchester City could be open to a departure for Couto this summer. Despite his obvious potential, it appears they do not have a clear path for him into the first team, and with only a year remaining on his contract, it might make sense for them to sell in the next transfer window to recoup some of his value. Couto will not be short of suitors if he is available this summer. While his trip to the Santiago Bernabeu exposed that he is far from flawless defensively, his quality on the ball will be sufficient for many to take a gamble on him.","Couto will not be short of suitors if he is available this summer.

84,Tuchel says there was 'no need' for Upamecano's red card in Bayern UCL defeat,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tuchel-says-there-was-no-need-for-Upamecanos-red-card-in-Bayern-UCL-defeat/3302054,1 day ago,"Thomas Tuchel called out Dayot Upamecano for giving away the penalty that saw Lazio claim their first-leg round of 16 win against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night.  The Bundesliga champions were looking to bounce back quickly from their difficult weekend tie against league leaders Bayer Leverkusen, but found themselves unable to push past their hosts in Rome. After failing to convert a number of strong first-half chances courtesy of Harry Kane and Jamal Musiala, Bayern Munich's fortunes went from bad to worse after the break. A hefty challenge from the France international on Lazio's forward Gustav Isaksen not only saw a penalty handed to their opponents, but Bayern go down to 10 men after Upamecano was given a straight red card. Ciro Immobile was able to smoothly convert the penalty and send Lazio through to the second-leg at the Allianz next month with a slender lead.   After the final whistle, the former Chelsea manager stressed that he was 'frustrated' with the result, and his player's actions - but reserved criticism for the whole team performance itself. 'We're frustrated and angry about the defeat,' Tuchel said. 'I think we lost the game, I'm not sure Lazio won it. 'We did everything we could to fall behind, making errors and losing confidence. (There was) no need for Upamecano to go in like that. It's not wild or intentional - but just block the shot.' As the clock ran down, Bayern Munich looked increasingly impatient hunting for an equaliser, but it was Isaksen who had arguably the strongest chance after the penalty and Lazio were unlucky not to go 2-0 up. Tuchel said that the defeat was 'completely our responsibility', citing early chances from his side that went untaken. 'We started well, had a chance in the first minute and then with Harry Kane and then with Jamal Musiala,' Tuchel continued. 'We had the game under control in the first half. 'But in the second our performance dropped inexplicably. We made too many individual errors and made our opponents stronger and we lost concentration. We lost our rhythm. 'It was completely our responsibility. We lost a game today that in the first half looked like we could not lose it.'   But despite having recorded his 10th defeat in his 43 matches in charge, Tuchel brushed off claims that his job was in danger. 'Worried about my future? No I am not,' he added. Before the second-leg on home soil in March, Bayern Munich will look to continue their climb to the top of the Bundesliga against sides including VfL Bochum, Freiburg, and RB Leipzig. The serial champions sit five points off Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who are unbeaten since the start of their impressive Bundesliga campaign.","The serial champions sit five points off Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who are unbeaten since the start of their impressive Bundesliga campaign."
85,Ligue 1 Review | Now or never for Kylian MbappÃ© and PSG,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ligue-1-Review-%7C-Now-or-never-for-Kylian-Mbapp%C3%A9-and-PSG/3300890,12 Feb,"Paris Saint-Germainâs 3-1 victory against Lille OSC over the weekend looked title-defining as Les Parisiens stretched their lead at the top of Ligue 1 by eleven points. It was an impressive victory over one of the most inform teams in the league as they came from behind to dismantle their opposition, and was made more so by the fact that this was achieved with Kylian MbappÃ© sat watching from the bench.  It was obvious that the forward was not going to start for the reigning champions over the weekend, but it was suspected that they might still rely on his efforts late in the game. The French captain had been closely monitored in the days leading up to the Lille fixture after suffering a bruising tackle from Lillian Brassier as the club progressed past Stade Brestois in the Coupe de France. However, what was not obvious was the amount of rotations that Luis Enrique would field, and how well the team coped with these drastic changes, as they kept one eye fixed firmly on the upcoming Champions League tie against Real Sociedad. Gianluigi Donnarumma, Marquinhos, Vitinha, Bradley Barcola, Warren ZaÃ¯re-Emery, and Achraf Hakimi were all absent as PSG made seven changes from their victory over Brest. Lille will of course point to the absurdity of calling this a âweakenedâ PSG side, as despite the heavy rotations, the Parisiansâ frontline still cost the club over â¬200 million in the summer, with Luis Enrique calling upon World Cup winner Ousmane DembÃ©lÃ©, Randal Kolo Muani, and GonÃ§alo Ramos to lead his attack. Still, winning without MbappÃ© has not been a given for PSG this season, and until this game, Kolo Muani and Ramos had flattered to deceive since joining and serious questions were beginning to form over their future in Paris. The clubâs ambitions have rested heavily on MbappÃ© who has defined their creative intentions as their top goal scorer and their leader on the pitch. The two games in which MbappÃ© did not start were two of the worst performances for the club this season as they were held to draws against FC Lorient and Toulouse FC. Both games came at the start of the season in the wake of MbappÃ©âs contractual dispute with the club and they had left what looked like an indelible mark on Luis Enriqueâs assessment of his charges. Following the Toulouse game, Luis Enrique started MbappÃ© in every single match for PSG. This even included games where the club were heavily favoured to win, such as in their Coupe de France ties against amateur side US Revel and third-division team US OrlÃ©ans Loiret. This is why the Lille game appeared so significant as until this point it had felt like Luis Enrique could not trust his team without their talismanic figure leading the attack. However, now the manager has a defined benchmark for the progress that has been made since the start of the season, and has proof that his squad has a depth that can allow him to turn his attention to the one thing that truly matters to Les Parisiens: the pursuit of the Champions League. There is a now-or-never feeling to this seasonâs competition for PSG. It appears to be one of the worst-kept secrets in football that MbappÃ© will be leaving the club to join Real Madrid in the summer, and this has fuelled an unspoken anxiety surrounding the team that this could prove to be their best opportunity to secure that elusive title, while they can still rely on the best player in the world. Luis Enrique will take no chances against Real Sociedad. Defeat to the Basque side in the Round of 16 would be catastrophic, but not unthinkable for a club that has exited this competition at this exact stage for the past two seasons running. Failure to win with MbappÃ© still present in the side would lead to a serious question for the future: how could they hope to win the competition without him?

Sunderland are flying under Beale and overturned a half time deficit to steamroller Plymouth with three cracking goals after the break, with Jobe Bellingham and Jack Clarke firingthe Mackems into the play off places. And Beale was visibly moved by a huge fourth minute ovation by the whole of the Stadium of Light for his four year old niece Poppy who this week had a relapse in her Leukaemia battle. Earlier this week Beale revealed his heartbreak on Instagram, writing: ""Our beautiful niece Poppy just a baby and she has gone through so much in her life already. ""In December 2022 she rang the bell for the end of her cancer treatment. This week, her parents received the devastating news she had relapsed. Poppy is now fighting this horrible disease head on again. It's heartbreaking for her parents, little brother and the extended family.â Asked about it after the match, Beale had to pause his press conference, overcome by emotion, to compose himself, and said: âIt is hard to speak about it, thanks to everyone.â Sub Bellingham, teenage brother of Real Madrid and England star Jude, sealed the points by scoring with his first touch of the ball after coming on. He curled a right foot shot into the top corner from 18 yards. Earlier star winger Jack Clarke netted his 14th of the season, an even more spectacular effort, dribbling down the wing, quitting inside and bending a brilliant shot in off the post. Pierre Ekwah curled in the levelled from a free kick 20 yards out, after the 1,200 Argyle fans who made the 820 mile round trip to the North East were rewarded with the opener. Morgan Whittaker pinged a first time ball into the Mackem half and Ryan Hardie was onside because he was lurking just inside his own half. His finish was cool, rounding Anthony Patterson who was 40 yards off his line, but then chipping over the keeper when he recovered to try and block. Beale said: âJackâs strike was fantastic the power he generated and Jobeâs wasnât bad. âWe only played in one half. We went bold in our line up. We are mixing up the goals, a huge positive. It is an important win because you see where it has taken us.â Plymouth coach Ian Foster said: âIt was a one-sided decision making process from the referee.â",Plymouth coach Ian Foster said: âIt was a one-sided decision making process from the referee.â

89,Conor Gallagher 'wants to stay at Chelsea' claimsÂ Mauricio Pochettino,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Conor-Gallagher-wants-to-stay-at-Chelsea-claims%C2%A0Mauricio-Pochettino/3301272,13 Feb,"Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino believes Conor Gallagher wants to stay at the club, despite continued uncertainty over the England international's future.  Gallagher produced a match winning display against Crystal Palace, with the one-time Eagles loanee scoring twice at Selhurst Park. The 24-year-old's second goal in stoppage time gave the Blues a 2-1 lead, with Enzo Fernandez adding a third in the closing seconds. Pochettino insisted after the victory that Gallagher wants to remain at the club. The Chelsea boss, however, admitted Gallagher's future is something for the midfielder and club to resolve due to his contract expiring in the summer of 2025.  'What he told me was to stay at Chelsea,' Pochettino said. 'But then it's about him and the club. I'm not suffering with this type of thing, he still has one year more on his contract. 'I think it is a matter for him and the club.' Gallagher had been linked with a move across London to rivals Tottenham in both the summer and January transfer windows. Chelsea were reported to have been open to a sale due to profit and sustainability rules. A sale would have allowed Chelsea greater room to operate in the transfer market due to the sale of a homegrown player representing pure profit. Gallagher was believed to be in no rush to leave his boyhood club, with the England international set to be in an even stronger position come the summer as his contract runs down. The 24-year-old has made 32 appearances in all competitions this season and started 23 of the Blues 24 Premier League matches - with his only absence due to suspension.  Gallagher, who has scored three goals in his last two games, has regularly captained Chelsea this season. Pochettino hailed the midfielder as 'priceless' after the victory over Crystal Palace, noting his contribution in both attack and defence. 'He's a player with great commitment with the team,' Pochettino said. 'Always trying to compensate every situation in an offensive and defensive situation and that is priceless to have a player like him. 'I'm so happy for him and I'm so happy for the team because it's a victory we needed, the three points to confirm the reaction after Wolverhampton. 'It was a very good game against Aston Villa and it was a great opportunity.'",'It was a very good game against Aston Villa and it was a great opportunity.'
90,Palmer admits he is 'surprised by how well it's gone' at Chelsea since transfer,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Palmer-admits-he-is-surprised-by-how-well-its-gone-at-Chelsea-since-transfer/3302235,1 day ago,"Cole Palmer admits it will be 'weird' going back to Manchester City on Saturday as a Chelsea player.  Palmer makes a first return to the Etihad Stadium since moving to west London in a surprise switch at the end of the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old cost Chelsea an initial Â£40million with an additional Â£2.5m in possible add-ons, but the deal has proved value for money as Palmer tops the Blues' scoring charts with 12 goals. 'I have been surprised by how well it's gone here so quickly, but I always back myself to succeed,' Palmer told the club's official website. 'I'm looking forward to going back to the Etihad. It will be strange, a weird feeling, but I'm looking forward to it and the team's looking forward to it.   'I'm very excited to be honest, even though it will be strange. 'Obviously I played against them at Stamford Bridge, but I think going back to the Etihad will be even stranger.' The two teams produced a remarkable 4-4 draw at Stamford Bridge in November when Palmer equalised from the penalty spot in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Ten of Palmer's Chelsea goals have come in the Premier League and his form has catapulted him into contention for a place in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer. 'When I made the decision to come down here with my family it was a really tough decision to leave,' said Palmer, who joined City at the age of eight and began the season by scoring for them in the Community Shield and Super Cup final. 'But I felt like I was ready to play week in, week out and showcase my ability. 'So thank you to the club and everyone who has supported me. 'It's down to the manager (Mauricio Pochettino) giving me the freedom, the club giving me the opportunity and the lads, who have been great with me since I came in. 'I've settled fast so I'm enjoying it here.'  Chelsea have had an inconsistent season under Pochettino and are currently 10th in the Premier League, 20 points behind leaders Liverpool and 18 adrift of City. But successive 3-1 wins at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, the former coming in the FA Cup, have ensured that Chelsea take on Pep Guardiola's English, European and FIFA World Club champions with growing confidence. Palmer said: 'The manager helps us all every day. Little conversations telling us what to do. 'We have meetings and he believes in us and we believe in ourselves. 'Everyone's going to talk when you're not doing well, but we just need to try and block it out and focus on ourselves.'","'Everyone's going to talk when you're not doing well, but we just need to try and block it out and focus on ourselves.'"

Yet the Blaugrana are unlikely to use that strategy to reel in a key piece from their rivals.  Defender Mario Hermoso has been a key part of Diego Simeoneâs renaissance job at the Metropolitano over the past 12 months, and is out of contract at the end of the season. The club have been deadlocked in their contract talks with Hermoso for some time now, and it looks as if he might leave at the end of the season. Earlier this week it was reported that Barcelona were considering a move for Hermoso, but Matteo Moretto has explained to The Daily Briefing that the Blaugrana are unlikely to make a move for the 28-year-old this summer. Hermoso has excellent ability on the ball, and has been crucial for Atletico of late. That said, Barcelona do have a stable of defenders already at their disposal in Inigo Martinez, Ronald Araujo, Andreas Christensen and Jules Kounde, although there has been talk of sales in recent months.","Hermoso has excellent ability on the ball, and has been crucial for Atletico of late.

94,Maguire's retrial in Greece for assaulting police postponed for over a year,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Maguires-retrial-in-Greece-for-assaulting-police-postponed-for-over-a-year/3299214,11 Feb,"Harry Maguire's long-awaited retrial in Greece for assault and attempted bribery has been shelved for more than a year and may never take place, according to a report.  Manchester United and England defender Maguire's hearing was finally expected to take place this month on the island of Mykonos before a legal strike caused a delay. It has now been over three years since Maguire, 30, was holidaying with a group including his wife, Fern Hawkins, his sister Daisy and his brother Joe. After an alleged altercation, Maguire was arrested and later found guilty of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and attempted bribery. He had been held by the police and spent two nights in a cell before appearing in court, where his lawyers were given just two hours to prepare their case.  Maguire was handed a 21-month suspended sentence for his alleged involvement in a brawl, though his lawyers lodged an appeal - quashing the original verdict. The legal strike led to the postponement of the retrial, however, and The Sun have claimed that it is not expected to take place until next March at the earliest. Prosecution lawyer Yannis Paradisis, speaking before the date of the retrial was pencilled in, told The Guardian: 'The case is going to be adjourned. 'The strike has meant court proceedings cannot take place.' Paradisis represents two of the police officers who alleged that Maguire, formerly United's captain, kicked and punched them on the island.  He said his clients were 'patient men' and added: 'They are professionals and they know that justice [in this country] can take a long time.' Officials, though, are said to be reluctant to press on with the case due to concerns it has damaged the island's reputation and dealt a blow to tourism. A source told The Sun: 'Harry has - and always will - contest the charges. 'He was on holiday with friends and family and was understandably distraught. He doesn't want this hanging over him another day but respects the legal system.' Maguire claimed that the alleged altercation began outside the Bonbonniere bar after Daisy was injected with an unknown substance by two strangers.   He added that, despite wanting to take her to a hospital, he was taken to a police station and beaten. Worried he was part of a kidnap attempt, Maguire tried to flee. 'Some people will believe me, some people won't,' he told The Times in November 2022. 'But one thing I would say about Mykonos is that I have no regrets. 'I don't worry about what the outcome is going to be. I don't worry about anything to do with it because my conscience is so clear about what happened that night. 'The people who were there that night, we all understand what went on.'","'The people who were there that night, we all understand what went on.'"

The striker, 25, has once again been the subject of intense transfer speculation after entering the final year of his contract at the Parc des Princes, with long-term admirers Real Madrid firmly in the frame to land his signature. Mbappe has had Premier League interest in the past in the form of Liverpool, but it emerged earlier this week that the World Cup winner would actually be 'willing' to join Arsenal given it would allow him to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Henry. Speaking on CBS Sports Golazo, Henry was asked about Mbappe's future and said: ""Where he is going to go, no one knows, everyone thinks it is going to be one place."" Henry then went on to speak about the Olympics, where he will be a coach for France in the summer. He added: ""I didnât speak to him yet directly about the Olympic situation. I have been calling players, as you know, but I will keep that to myself obviously. But Mbappe went on TV the other day and said he would like to play them. But it will depend on the team [he picks this summer]."" While The Independent outlined Mbappe would be open-minded over a move to Arsenal, the report also made it clear that the Gunners would be highly unlikely to sanction such a move given it would shatter their current wage structure. It's understood that Mbappe, who is free to discuss a pre-contract agreement with teams from overseas, currently has an offer on the table from Real Madrid - the same team he came close to joining back in the summer of 2022 before changing his mind at the eleventh hour. The Spanish giants have tried to sign the former Monaco star on multiple occasions, although it remains to be seen if their latest proposal will be enough to finally lure him to the Bernabeu. Mbappe, who joined PSG from Monaco, has refused to be drawn on his future. It's been outlined in recent days, though, that executives at the club are braced for his departure in the summer.","Mbappe, who joined PSG from Monaco, has refused to be drawn on his future.

Los Blancos stormed past their title rivals in the Spanish capital with a dominant showing to increase their title lead to five points. Bellingham scored twice in another virtuoso midfield display for Carlo Ancelottiâs team but he was injured in the second half. The home fans were visibly concerned as Bellingham left the pitch with the post match conversation dominated by his fitness. Real Madrid restart their Champions League campaign with a midweek trip RB Leipzig and Bellinghamâs involvement remains in the balance. Ancelotti was asked about the England international in his post match press conference and he confirmed an ankle sprain for Bellingham. No further details were given by Ancelotti, but with such a short turnaround in between games, he is unlikely to recover in time. Bellingham will be assessed by the clubâs medical staff tomorrow, when the swelling reduces, with an update expected in the next 48 hours.","Bellingham will be assessed by the clubâs medical staff tomorrow, when the swelling reduces, with an update expected in the next 48 hours."

United have reportedly commenced transfer talks with Neves over a summer move. Neves, who has three senior caps for Portugal, was asked whether he will stay at Benfica but wasn't able to give a direct answer. Speaking at a press conference ahead of Benfica's Europa League game at home to Toulouse, Neves said: 'I promise to do my best in every training session, in every game, and I think that is one of my greatest qualities.  'I'm focused on Benfica and even more so on [Thursday's] game, which is the next one. I think I will do my best in every game and in every training session.' A product of Benfica's academy, Neves has made 55 senior appearances for the club since making his debut in December 2022. United could be set for a big summer in the transfer market as Erik ten Hag's side look to improve their fortunes. It is anticipated that United will reach an agreement with Newcastle next week to bring in Dan Ashworth as their new sporting director. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment for a 25 per cent stake in United has been approved by the FA. United defender Harry Maguire has praised Ratcliffe for bringing a 'fresh energy' to the club. The INEOS CEO recently spoke to the United players at the club's training ground. Maguire told Sky Sports: ''I'm sure he's going to have a positive impact on this club. 'As a player sitting here, I want this club to be successful.

Juventus began on a different path two years ago; our target is to return to the Champions League even if we last season got there. âSimone [Inzaghi] is doing extraordinary work, but I am not crazy when I say certain things. There are different levels. In my first five years at Juventus, we had the best team and it was normal to win. Even if victories are always extraordinary, that was the norm. The same goes for Inter now. Having earned 60 points with a game in hand, means they have a great pace, so Simone and his staff deserve praise. âI've always said Milan would have returned in the race. What we need to do now is work hard. I am happy with what the players have done until now. We have earned 52 points but we must get as many now,"" added Allegri. âOf course, young players need time to grow. It's about finding balance and it's normal. This team has excellent players. We could have done more against Inter, but we faced an extraordinary team. We must do something more because a Champions League placement is not granted yet and this moment can become tricky. Right now, we should not look at the table but earn the points we'll need for the Champions League. We have more points than we expected to have at this point at the start of the season.

After suffering a 2-0 defeat in the Riyadh Seasons Cup final, Ronaldo watched the awards ceremony from afar as Milinkovic-Savic collected his trophy along with Aleksandar Mitrovic winning the Player of the Tournament award. A less-than-impressed Ronaldo then appears to have enough before heading down the tunnel. Before heading to the changing rooms, Ronaldo then whips off his silver medal and launches it high into the air and into the stands. It's another bitter blow for the Portuguese star, who was beaten to the best player of the Club Arab Champions Cup in pre-season by none other than Milinkovic-Savic.  The Portuguese superstar had an eventful night on Wednesday as his Al-Nassr side suffered a 2-0 defeat in the Riyadh Season Cup final at the Kingdom Arena. Goals from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Salem Aldawsari helped the Saudi Pro League leaders to a comfortable win. It was a night to forget for Ronaldo, who made the headlines for all the wrong reasons following a series of outbursts. The 39-year-old was unable to ignore fans in the stadium chanting 'Messi, Messi, Messi'. Footage on social media appeared to show the former Real Madrid striker responding with some annoyance. 'I am here, not Messi,' Ronaldo appeared to say to the fans on Thursday night. The Al-Nassr skipper's anger boiled over at another point of the game, as he received a yellow card from referee Tori Penso for smashing the ball into the stands. Upset by the decision to award a free-kick to the opposition, Ronaldo couldn't resist launching the ball into the crowd.  On a surreal night in the Gulf State, that included an appearance from WWE legend The Undertaker, Ronaldo was not done with his antics. Footage that appeared on X, formerly known as Twitter, showed the forward walking down the tunnel at the Kingdom Arena, before a fan threw an Al-Hilal shirt at him. As he approached the tunnel, he picked the shirt up before seemingly rubbing it against his crotch and throwing it back towards the crowd in frustration. It appeared as though the only shirts that were thrown towards the star were that of the rival team, in an attempt to goad the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. Ronaldo then continued down the tunnel, followed by his team-mates, before the video ended. Ronaldo was also caught fuming at an unsuspecting member of support staff as he led his squad to pick up their runners-up medals With his path down the guard of honour obstructed by the official, Ronaldo threw his hands up in frustration and proceeded down the line stony-faced. Before the game, Ronaldo watched on as 'The Deadman' made a surprise appearance before the Riyadh Season Cup game.  Ronaldo, who recently celebrated his 39th birthday, stood in line on Thursday, before the wrestling icon appeared. With his theme music blaring out at the venue, The Undertaker wandered out of the tunnel at the Kingdom Arena, in his full WWE attire. The cult legend made his way out onto the pitch, as both teams lined up prior to kick-off before getting his hand on the Riyadh Season Cup.","The cult legend made his way out onto the pitch, as both teams lined up prior to kick-off before getting his hand on the Riyadh Season Cup."

This evening Paris Saint-Germain take on Real Sociedad, and Real Madridâs players will no doubt be discussing it.  After their win in Germany, Tchouameni admitted that PSG forward Kylian Mbappe was a topic of conversation in the dressing room. His future continues to dominate headlines in both France and Spain, with both clubs hanging on his decision. âMbappe to Real Madrid? He didnât say anything to me. And even if I knew, I wouldnât have told you. We talk about it in the dressing room because itâs an important issue. We hope things calm down in the coming weeks,â he admitted. Regarding the clash with RB Leipzig, Tchouameni said he was happy with his display in central defence. âIn the end we won, we created chances, we scored. I had a good performance. I spoke with the coach, I try to give everything, regardless of the position. At Madrid the most important thing is to win titles,â Tchouameni told Canal+, as quoted by Marca.

104,Barcelona star to decide future after discussions with Xavi Hernandez replacement,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-star-to-decide-future-after-discussions-with-Xavi-Hernandez-replacement/3301369,14 Feb,"Last week, Barcelona head coach Xavi Hernandez re-iterated his desire for Sergi Roberto to continue at the club beyond the end of this season, despite his own departure. The 44-year-old coach has been a big backer of the veteran midfielder, although reports have suggested that those higher up are not so keen on the 31-year-old.  After Xavi announced that he would be stepping down in the summer, it was widely reported that Roberto would also be leaving, as his contract would not be extended. However, according to Sport, this is far from the truth, as the Catalan giants are prepared to offer a renewal to Roberto, who is highly valued within the club for his involvement, role in the dressing room and his very low salary. According to the report, Roberto is in no hurry to decide his future. He intends to hold talks with Xaviâs successor, once they are appointed, in order to figure out how involved he would be in plans for next season. If he were to be far down the pecking order, he would strongly consider leaving. Robertoâs commitment to Barcelona over the last decade or so has been incredibly strong, and as club captain, he has earned the right to decide his own future. For now, the situation remains open.","Robertoâs commitment to Barcelona over the last decade or so has been incredibly strong, and as club captain, he has earned the right to decide his own future.

105,Mourinho loved time at Man United as he opens up on rumours of replacing Ten Hag,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mourinho-loved-time-at-Man-United-as-he-opens-up-on-rumours-of-replacing-Ten-Hag/3302729,13 hours ago,"Jose Mourinho loved his time at Manchester United but won't be returning to the dugout anytime soon.  The recently sacked Roma joined Rio Ferdinand on VIBE with FIVE, and candidly looked back fondly on his spell as Old Trafford boss. The Portuguese won the Carabao Cup and Europa League in his first season with the club, but only lasted just over two years before being sacked in December 2018. Arriving as one of Europe's elite managers having won titles at Porto, Chelsea, Inter and Real Madrid, he enjoyed more success than any United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 and famously said finishing second in the Premier League in 2018 was one of his greatest achievements in football. âI loved it, I loved my time there,â he said. âI was so proud of going there. âI was even prouder when a couple of years later I went back as a Sky commentator with Roy Keane and felt the reaction of the crowd. I was like 'wow'. âI always felt like we were together in the time I was there, but to have that reaction touched me. I loved my time there. âThe club, the history, everything, to be a coach in the same club as Sir Alex, you have to feel it, you have to feel the pride and responsibility and I felt it.â  He continued: âI was very very proud to be there and it was not easy, I donât think the media helped me. âIt was not with an intention of hurting, but it was more the people didnât understand the dimension of the job and the particular difficulties.â Mourinho went on to explain those difficulties, namely the lack of cohesion above him between executives and the owners. He also took time to defend former CEO Ed Woodward, who worked above him, later stepping aside in 2022.  Mourinho explained: âThe coach was in a hybrid position because in the years before everything was clear with the ownership, Sir Alex and David Gill, that was changing and then the structure was not fluid. âWhen people criticise Ed Woodwardâs job, I donât like it because for me heâs a good man, but just a man who was like a fish out of water. Very intelligent, very polite, very correct, but not prepared for the sport side of it. âFor a coach not to have a direct communication with the owners and not to have a structure that shares the same principals and the same ideas was not easy and had consequences at many levels, but I did my best. âI love the club, I love the fans, I hope that everything goes well, Iâm waiting for Man United to become your Man United that I fell in love with.â Like Mourinho, current manager Erik ten Hag won the Carabao Cup in his first season in charge and is now feeling the heat in some quarters. Quizzed about the rumours claiming Mourinho is desperate to return to Old Trafford where he has âunfinished businessâ, he said: âNo, not true. No, no, no.â United are currently sixth in the Premier League and still in contention to finish in the top four.",United are currently sixth in the Premier League and still in contention to finish in the top four.
106,Exclusive: Emmanuel Petit questions Xaviâs criticism of Barcelona media â âHe knows the realityâ,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Exclusive-Emmanuel-Petit-questions-Xavi%E2%80%99s-criticism-of-Barcelona-media-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%9CHe-knows-the-reality%E2%80%9D/3302236,1 day ago,"Itâs safe to say that it has been a bitterly disappointing season so far for Barcelona. They are already 10 points off Real Madrid in the La Liga title race, failed to win the Spanish Super Cup, and are out of the Copa del Rey. The Champions League looks to be their only chance of a trophy, although even then, their chances of success there are very unlikely.  The campaign started well enough for the Catalans, but the last few months has seen them drop off massively. It was during this period that Real Madrid stretched their advantage in La Liga, and that they exited the two domestic cup competitions without success. Even then, they only stumbled their way to top spot in their UCL group, which was arguably the weakest of anyoneâs. Speaking exclusively to Football EspaÃ±a, Emmanuel Petit gave his thoughts as to why his former club has struggled so much in recent months. âI think you have so many reasons for that. There has been so many fights on and off the pitch. Iâve been told that Xavi has some problems with Deco, we all know the troubles that they have been having financially for many years too. âOn the pitch, theyâve conceded far too many goals in recent weeks. Last season they were very difficult to beat, they barely conceded. Itâs not the same structure, they donât have the same heart as before. They donât have enough mental strength, they donât kill games off when they have the chance. They arenât the same team, they donât have the same confidence as before. They have so many problems, and Iâm not even talking about Xavi, about the pressure on him.â Petit also noted Barcelonaâs injury crisis as a key reason for their underperformance. He believes that the clubâs medical team need to be scrutinised because of this, as he used the example of Ousmane Dembele, who has been injury-free since moving to France last summer, despite constantly being in the treatment room during his time on Catalonia. âTop players have been injured for many weeks â theyâve lost the spine of the team. I have to ask, why Ousmane Dembele hasnât been injured with Paris Saint-Germain? Heâs been injured so many times at Barcelona, so can anyone explain that situation?â Last month, Xavi announced that he would be stepping down at the end of the season. The 44-year-old coach has had a troubled relationship with the media over recent months, which he claims played a big role in his decision. Upon announcing his resignation, Xavi also states that Barcelona would never have a manager that stays for many, many years â similarly to what Sir Alex Ferguson did at Manchester United (26 years) â as âthe media would not allow it to be the caseâ. Petit shared his thoughts on these remarks. âXavi said heâs going to leave at the end of the season, he could even quit sooner. My feeling from the outside is that Xavi has had enough of the situation â I think heâs tired of it, I think the players can feel that too, and they are also tired of the situation. âItâs easy for Xavi to blame the media. In modern football, even in the past, itâs very rare to stay at a club for 20 years. The last case has been Jurgen Klopp with Liverpool, or Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Before that, it was Arsene Wenger (at Arsenal). âI know that Xavi has been complaining about many things over the last few months â referees, money, players or anything. Barcelona fans will always love Xavi for what he has done at the club, especially as a player, but when you manage a big club like this, you have to be aware that you are under pressure every single game. When things donât turn around in a good way, you are under pressure.â Petit did acknowledge that the scrutiny in Spain is considerably more than in other countries across Europe, although he believes that for clubs like Barcelona, itâs still part and parcel of the job, considering the expectations that are placed on the team not only by the media, but supporters too. âIt was the case when I was at Barcelona. Every day at training, we were in front of 15 journalists for every session, and they were trying to create stories or sensations. Itâs always been like that, so Xavi knows the reality with managing big clubs like this because he has been with Barcelona for years. He knows when you are at big clubs like this, you donât have time to create a vision, especially when we all know Barcelonaâs DNA of tiki-taka, attacking football all the time. âThe pressure in Spain is much higher than here in France. The football for passion isnât as high as places like Spain, England or Italy. Iâm very surprised when some managers or players are shocked with the criticism they are getting â if you donât want to deal with big speculation, donât manage at top clubs. Go to the second division or change sports, itâs as simple as that. If you want to manage at Barcelona, to compete with the biggest clubs on the biggest stage, you need to know what it takes, so donât complain.â While Xavi was a player for many years at Barcelona, so he would understand the pressure, it is completely difference as a manager, as you are seen as the person responsible for the teamâs results and performances â when things go wrong, you are the first person to be criticised and scrutinised. There are correct points on both sides of the argument, so itâs a fair debate to be had either way. It is clear that Xavi has been pretty successful as Barcelona manager during his 2+ years in charge, even if he ends this season without a trophy. However, it has been a disappointing ending to this stage, although there is time for the Blaugrana to turn things around before the campaign comes to a close.","It is clear that Xavi has been pretty successful as Barcelona manager during his 2+ years in charge, even if he ends this season without a trophy.

107,Manchester City will allow Barcelona target to leave this summer,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Manchester-City-will-allow-Barcelona-target-to-leave-this-summer/3301562,2 days ago,"Itâs been a tough season so far for Barcelona, but one of the bright spots has been Joao Cancelo. The 29-year-old joined last summer on a season-long loan deal from Manchester City, and he has largely impressed, despite regularly being played away from his natural position of right-back.  Understandably, Barcelona hope to re-sign Cancelo this summer. It wonât be an easy operation due to their ongoing financial woes, but there is still hope that a deal can be agreed with Man City. This is even more the case as Man City do not see Cancelo as having a future with them, as per MD. As such, they will negotiate this exit once again, whether that be to Barcelona or another club. Barcelona will hope that they can win the race to sign Cancelo. They believe that they have the playerâs full wishes to say, which should give them an advantage. However, they still need to stump up the cash to buy him permanently, which is easier said than done at this stage.","Barcelona will hope that they can win the race to sign Cancelo.

109,ALVISE CAGNAZZO: Conte wants to stay in Italy after his failed stint at Spurs,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/ALVISE-CAGNAZZO-Conte-wants-to-stay-in-Italy-after-his-failed-stint-at-Spurs/3301346,14 Feb,"Antonio Conte is the man of desire for all the top clubs in Serie A.  He is currently out of work after his break up with Tottenham and has decided to return to live in Turin, to be close to his daughter Vittoria and her family. Today, he accompanies his daughter to school and lives surrounded by his loved ones. He decided to become a father and detoxify himself from the waste of stress. He loves the sea and now that he lives in the hills he still loves to spend his holidays between Liguria and his beloved Puglia, in Lecce. The failed experience at Tottenham, the arguments with the media and the death of great friends Giampiero Ventrone and Gianluca Vialli have profoundly changed his life. He now wants to make up for the time lost abroad to look after and raise his family, and to be close to his wife and daughter who have always lived in Turin. Conte wants to stay in Italy and would only accept a new offer from the Premier League if he was certain that he would not be able to return to Juventus, or have the chance to coach Napoli or AC Milan.  Living abroad was an exceptional educational path for him but in some way it deprived the man Antonio Conte of the simplest family desires. Now 54-years-old, he is no longer a young coach looking for glory but a mature man who wants to continue coaching without losing contact with Italy. He still has eight to 10 years ahead of him at great levels before his football goes in the same path that has already shattered Massimiliano Allegri's tactical certainties. NAPOLI DREAM OF CONTE Napoli is among the few clubs that could satisfy Conte's wishes from a planning and technical point of view because it possesses a potential Ballon d'Or winner like Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and because they want to return to the top after a unsuccessful season. Conte decided not to replace Rudi Garcia earlier this season as he no longer wants to take a team halfway through the season. His family would remain in Turin, a few hours' flight from Napoli and would not change his habits for the umpteenth time by trying to repeat the sporting miracle achieved after over 30 years by Luciano Spalletti's team last season.  Winning a scudetto in Naples is much more difficult than doing so at a top club like Juventus, Inter or AC Milan and this generates many expectations in the head of the Apulian coach. According to Tuttosport, Conte could still accept Napoli's proposal in June 2024. At the end of the season everything will be clearer on his horizon and the Neapolitan club is probably one of the best solutions. Conte is the right man when there are no international competitions and Napoli seriously risks not qualifying for any European competition. Today they are in ninth place in Serie A, closer to Torino than to Inter in the standings, and this is a sign of failure on which Conte's determination can build new triumphs.  CONTE WOULD MAKE NAPOLI FANS DREAM AGAIN Among the narrow alleys of San Gregorio Armeno, Conte would be treated like a divinity. His extraordinary charismatic energy would allow the fans to dream again after the technical disaster experienced with Rudi Garcia and Walter Mazzari - the temporary coach who has a worse points average than his French predecessor. If Conte needed love in Naples he would find it without any particular problems, without even paying too much attention to relations with the media and his polemical character would become a shield against any external attack. The city has always dreamed of having Jose Mourinho on the bench but his 'Roman nature' and the excessive cost of his ancient football would be too much of a burden to bear. This is why Conte represents the right man who could be in the right place, on the bench of the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.   CONTE FACES DE LAURENTIIS PROBLEM - BUT CAN REBUILD TEAM WITH OSIMHEN'S MILLIONS You don't have to be overly fussy to understand how Conte in Naples would have major diplomatic problems with president Aurelio De Laurentiis. Both have a very strong character, a tough soul and an extraordinary passion for motivational dialogues. In Italy there is a very famous motto: 'Two roosters in the henhouse cannot co-exist together' and this ancient popular phrase perfectly captures the situation that every coach who approaches Napoli experiences.  In the spring, De Laurentiis and the Neapolitan club will look to satisfy the technical requests of Conte, but not the economic ones because no Italian club could shell out the same amount that he received during his time at Tottenham. Conte wants to win and to do so he needs players who are at the top of the game or very close to becoming one. The sale of Victor Osimhen this summer would cost around Â£100m and the Italian coach could manage the next transfer almost personally as he has always dreamed of. If Conte has the chance to be a complete manager, by actively choosing the players to buy, Napoli would certainly become his first choice.  CONTE IN LOVE WITH JUVENTUS In addition to Napoli, there is obviously the most fascinating and least difficult hypothesis for Antonio Conte - returning to Juventus. Conte's career as a Juventus player is full of successes with five Serie A titles, the Champions League, UEFA Cup, the Coppa Italia and the European Super Cup.  His greatest wish is that to also win the Champions League as a coach. Allegri's 405 games are a perfect snapshot of his importance in recent years for Juventus. Today, however, his time seems to have expired and his football appears to be ancient, old and frankly out of place. Against Udinese, Juventus didn't have a shot on target for 45 minutes playing at the Allianz Stadium. Conte's return to Juventus is possible, by the coach's own admission who during an interview with 'Belve' on Rai2 said he regretted leaving Juventus. Who would immediately benefit from the former Tottenham manager's return to Turin? Federico Chiesa would certainly be the happiest player in the locker room.  ONLY CONTE CAN SAVE CHIESA Chiesa has always been a fundamental player for Juventus and has always been highly appreciated by Conte. The Italian coach would not let the Italian winger be debased in the role of second striker but would tactically rebuild the team to enhance his technical characteristics. Going from 3-5-2 to 3-4-2-1 or 4-2-4, the true model of Conte's early career, would represent an upgrade for Chiesa's career.  Conte's return could be an electric shock for all the players. His presence on the bench would even be linked to the permanence of the Italian winger who would become the icon of the team's new technical course. Conte's arrival would stop the potential hemorrhage of players and would allow them to recreate a strong group from which to start again to win points and consolidate the team's growth. Chiesa would return to being a fundamental player, the future captain of the team who will enhance the tradition of the great Italian players who wore the captain's armband like Alessandro Del Piero.","Chiesa would return to being a fundamental player, the future captain of the team who will enhance the tradition of the great Italian players who wore the captain's armband like Alessandro Del Piero."

The England midfielder was not named in the Real squad for the trip after a sprained ankle forced him off in Saturdayâs 4-0 win over surprise LaLiga title rivals Girona â but not before he had scored a brace. Bellingham has scored 20 goals in 31 appearances for Real and rapidly become one of their most important players but manager Carlo Ancelotti is confident his side can cope. âWe have to think that Bellingham isnât here, but weâve won four out of four games without him,â the Italian said at his pre-match press conference. âThose who have replaced him have done very well, like Brahim (Diaz) or Joselu. âHeâs a very important player, but I think this has been an opportunity to get more motivated. âWe arrive on the back of a good run â the form is good. We are up against a good side with plenty of quality that plays a high-tempo game. âWe have shown lots of character, and credit to the team. The vibe is good.â Leipzig boss Marco Rose, who coached Bellingham at Borussia Dortmund in 2021-22, is not convinced the 20-year-old will not feature on Tuesday. Carlo Ancelotti  Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Monday, he said: âI wonât believe that Jude will be out until heâs not in the stadium tomorrow. âI know Jude, I know that he will do everything to play a Champions League game.â Even without Bellingham, Ancelotti has plenty of star-power to choose from, but Rose insists his side will not be intimidated. âWeâre certainly not afraid,â he said. âWeâre looking forward to the opponent, to the task, to our stadium. Thatâs what we want. What we worked hard for last season and now in the group stage. âReal Madrid have developed outstandingly this season and become one of the strongest teams in Europe. They are in exceptionally good shape â in all areas. âThey know what it means to play in the Champions League and win it too. And we know about their qualities. âBut weâre not that bad and we have great footballers in our ranks. We will give everything and look for our opportunities to develop a good starting position.â Defender Mohamed Simakan is in contention despite picking up a knock in the weekend Bundesliga draw at Augsburg, while midfielder Amadou Haidara has stepped up training after picking up a knee problem on Mali duty at the Africa Cup of Nations but remains doubtful.","Defender Mohamed Simakan is in contention despite picking up a knock in the weekend Bundesliga draw at Augsburg, while midfielder Amadou Haidara has stepped up training after picking up a knee problem on Mali duty at the Africa Cup of Nations but remains doubtful."

The Dutchman is set to be their highest paid player again next season, after earning just under â¬25m this season.  His already high wages were inflated by the wage deferrals agreed during the pandemic with President Josep Maria Bartomeu, and thus far, Barcelona have been able to sell de Jong on a new deal. As per Jijantes, carried by Sport, Barcelona have made a new contract offer to de Jong to extend his deal and lower his wages dramatically, which he is considering now. His new deal would run until 2029. The Blaugreana will hear out offers for de Jong this summer too, knowing they have to make at least one major sale, and that his wages would be one of their largest costs off the books. While he remains a key player for Barcelona, he is not quite hitting the heights money would like, and that his wages would suggest. Given he is out of contract in 2026, de Jong holds plenty of power if he doesnât decide to renew his deal. He would be one of the best earners in European football if he were to see out his deal until that point, which may strain relations with Barcelona, but after reports that he is open to a move, then he could hit free agency at the age of 2028.","Given he is out of contract in 2026, de Jong holds plenty of power if he doesnât decide to renew his deal.

Kylian Mbappeâs incoming move to Real Madrid is expected to trigger changes in Paris as part of a transfer overhaul. Despite not receiving a fee for Mbappe, his departure will release a major contract burden, and PSG are aiming to strengthen. Luis Enrique is a huge fan of Gavi with the pair previously working together with the Spanish national team.  Barcelona have no current plans to sell the 19-year-old, due to his importance in Catalonia, but their ongoing financial issues could dictate the situation. As per a report from The Athletic, PSG are ready to solidify their long term interest in Gavi, despite the teenager currently being sidelined with a knee injury. Gavi will miss out on Euro 2024, following surgery on the injury, but that has not deterred PSGâs desire to sign him.

114,"Why Man Utd are hoping City, Arsenal, Liverpool & other rivals do well in Europe",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Why-Man-Utd-are-hoping-City-Arsenal-Liverpool--other-rivals-do-well-in-Europe/3301327,13 Feb,"As the three European club competitions make a welcome return for their knockout stages this week, we have a very interesting little sideshow.  What has become known as the 'top four' in the Premier League could be about to become the 'top five' when it comes to Champions League qualification. But after both Manchester United and Newcastle United crashed out of Europe's top competition after the group stage, England's extra place hangs in the balance. The Premier League is currently jostling with Italy's Serie A, Germany's Bundesliga and Spain's LaLiga for just two additional spots in the expanded 36-team Champions League group stage next season. And, as it stands, the Premier League will miss out on that extra place with Italy and Germany rewarded instead.   That would obviously be a major blow to the self-styled 'best league in the world' and the performance of Man United and Newcastle before Christmas would be heavily to blame. But all hope isn't lost yet. A good performance by Manchester City and Arsenal in the Champions League from here, plus strong showings by the English clubs left in the Europa League and the Europa Conference League - all are taken into account in the sums - and England will get its fifth spot. UEFA is basing everything on its Association Club Coefficient ranking, a league table of all its member nations based on how their clubs get on. Ahead of the Champions League expansion, they're only looking at this season's performances to allocate the extra places. The best two leagues get one - that's where the Premier League is hoping to end up - as well as the one that finishes in fifth place (likely to be France or the Netherlands). The final extra spot in the 36-team group stage goes to the 'champions path' qualifiers - the domestic leagues who don't get a direct ticket to the group stage already. But while Premier League fans might be fretting about getting a fifth team in, according to Opta's calculations there's nothing to worry about. They predict England has a 77 per cent chance of getting it, with Italy on 50.4 per cent, Germany 48.3 per cent and Spain 12.5 per cent.     They say that although two English clubs bombed out of the Champions League in December, Man City and Arsenal carry strong hopes of a deep run and will boost the coefficient. What's more, Liverpool, West Ham and Brighton in the Europa League and Aston Villa in the Conference League should have a decent chance of getting through a few more rounds yet. At the moment, England's coefficient stands at 13.625 but Opta expected it will end up being 19.4 because one point is awarded for each round clubs reach from the last-16 onwards in the Champions League and Europa League. In the Conference League, Villa would have to get to the semi-finals to begin adding extra points but there's a decent chance of that. Good performances will ensure that fifth Champions League spot via the Premier League, which keeps Aston Villa, Man United, Newcastle, West Ham and Brighton hopeful of getting in. Villa sit fifth at the minute, one point behind Tottenham in fourth. But Man United closed the gap to Villa to five points by beating them on Sunday and they have Newcastle, West Ham and Brighton bunched behind them. So United and Newcastle really would owe their rivals one if they get the reward in May.",So United and Newcastle really would owe their rivals one if they get the reward in May.

The prolific Norwegian scored his first goals since returning to action from a foot injury as his late double finally saw off the resilient Toffees at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

Thatâs important and we have to keep going. âWe have already been on quite a good run. It is a good thing to start to click now. Thatâs never bad. Itâs in the next few months when you win things, so we keep going.â City found it tough to break down the stubborn Merseysiders, who are caught up in another relegation battle after their 10-point deduction earlier in the season. The breakthrough came soon after manager Pep Guardiola introduced the lively De Bruyne and Kyle Walker off the bench, and it was Haaland who delivered the blow as Everton struggled to clear a 70th-minute corner. Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne  De Bruyne then played in Haaland to secure the result five minutes from time. âBack to normal finally,â said Haaland. âItâs good to be back to normal. âWe knew how the game was going to be and they were going to make it difficult for us. âBut we knew if we trusted ourselves it was going to be really difficult for (Everton).

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti sat down in front of the press after his side defeated title challengers Girona at the Estadio Santiago BernabÃ©u. With the win, Los Blancos went 5 points clear at the top of the LaLiga standings. You must be proud of Madridâs fantastic win: âVery happy. We played the game at a very high level. We were very humble at the back; we had a very high defensive commitment. It allowed us to defend well, win balls back and take advantage of the quality we have in front of us.â What did Madrid do well to score four goals against Girona and keep a clean sheet? âI think we managed the game well. In defence, we played with a fairly low block to avoid problems at the back, considering the emergency [injury situation] we had. And then, we took advantage of good ball control in the opponentâs half, we used verticality to make transitions. I think we played wellâ. Not a single shot on goal conceded, how do you rate Carvajal and TchouamÃ©niâs performance together? âGood. The two centre-backs played very well and were helped by the full-backs. The defensive work of the three midfielders was also important and the front three also worked very hard. The defensive commitment was key to keeping a clean sheet in the matchâ. How is Bellinghamâs injury? âHe has a sprained ankle. We will assess it tomorrow. Would it be difficult to cover Bellinghamâs absence? When he hasnât been there, Brahim and Joselu have done well. Thatâs a strength of this team. How do you rate Viniciusâ current form? He is a top player. When he plays this way and with this attitude, he is the best in the world, in my opinion. Kroos was more of a pivot, almost a central defender at times. Did it cross your mind to put him as a pivot in the derby? Against AtlÃ©tico we didnât have tall centre backs. But now we do with TchouamÃ©ni. He didnât need a pivot in terms of aerial support. Camavinga is better as a midfelder in this match. How is RÃ¼diger after his injury diagnosis? Itâs from the Getafe game. Itâs been tough for him to overcome the bruising. Yesterday he tried but in a normal running session, in changes of direction bothered him. We preferred not to risk it. Nacho will be back on Tuesday. Today we broke the world record for injuries in central defenders. Is the title race over? Itâs a big result for LaLiga. Girona had never lost away from home. We are well positioned. We have done very well. It will give us energy for the Champions League. People compare Zidane to Bellingham... He reminds me of him in terms of quality, although Zidane had a higher level of quality, Bellingham gets in and around the goal. Very few players can make the movement he did for his first goal. Is the league in the bag? We have the advantage. We are one win and one draw in front. It is small. What do you mean when you say that âbeing humbleâ has been key? I meant that itâs not hard to run without the ball. Sometimes it is tough to give more. The sacrifice from the side was completely on show today. Vinicius, Bellingham, Rodrygo? What would you call this trident? I donât know, I donât have much imagination. I hope you look for it (laughs). Vinicius if he is the best... who is the second and the third? Bellingham [second] and the third is Rodrygo. Four, Kroos... Being on the Madrid bench today was very comfortable. What about MbappÃ©? That player belongs to another team (laughs). As for Carvajal, how do you get that performance as a central defender? I asked him which side of defence he preferred and he said he didnât care. TchouamÃ©ni said he preferred the left. He looked like he had played his 400 games at centere-back. You canât teach him anything, he has everything. We had our young central defenders injured. Marvel, Carrillo... I called up Jacobo, but he is a youth player. Before that I have to look at my team, and there were players to play as central defenders: TchouamÃ©ni and Carvajal.","As for Carvajal, how do you get that performance as a central defender?

118,Champions League predictions and tips for this weekâs Last 16 matches,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Champions-League-predictions-and-tips-for-this-week%E2%80%99s-Last-16-matches/3301166,13 Feb,"Weâve got three betting tips for this weekâs last 16 matches in the Champions League ranging from a 9/5 bet on PSG to a longer 6/1 shot in Real Madridâs trip to RB Leipzig.  The other is a tempting odds against play on the next opponents for Harry Kaneâs Bayern Munich, whose bid for a 12th consecutive Bundesliga title now looks seriously at risk after their 3-0 defeat to Xabi Alonsoâs unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend. Alonso himself remains the frontrunner to replace Jurgen Klopp as the next Liverpool manager from the start of the 2024/25 season (8/11 best price on BetVictor). Jude Bellingham was at it again as he scored two of the four goals that helped Real Madrid see off title rivals Girona on Saturday. The young Englishman, alongside Brazilian duo Vinicius Jnr and Rodrygo, is a sight to behold and can cause a lot of problems even in the absence of a recognised striker. RB Leipzig are their opponents in the Champions League Round of 16, the German side currently sitting in a Europa League spot in the Bundesliga. Lois Openda may have missed a penalty in their draw with Augsburg but he still managed to find the back of the net, making it four games in a row with a goal. Odds of 6/1 for both him and Vinicius to score in this one courtesy of Betfred is a tempting punt indeed. Bayern Munich had a top-of-the-table clash of their own on Saturday but they were well beaten by Xabi Alonsoâs Bayer Leverkusen, a late break being rounded off by Jeremie Frimpong sealing that win for the latter. Bayern were dominant in their UCL group though in fairness, collecting 16 points from an available 18. Lazio meanwhile picked up 10, including two wins over Celtic, and they will welcome the German Giants to the Stadio Olimpico. The Italian outfit are unbeaten in their last four on home soil and so odds of 6/4 for either a Lazio win or a draw William Hill is our pick of the bunch. The last time Paris Saint-Germain faced Spanish opposition in this tournament, they were beaten by eventual winners Real Madrid at this stage two years ago. Whilst Real Sociedad arenât quite as likely to go all the way as Los Blancos were then, they are no pushovers. They saw their six-game unbeaten run come to an end on the weekend against Osasuna, but the bigger worry for Imanol Alguacil is that his side have failed to score in their last four now. As a result, you may wish to bet on PSG to win to nil and make it five La Real games without a goal, at 9/5 on BetVictor.","They saw their six-game unbeaten run come to an end on the weekend against Osasuna, but the bigger worry for Imanol Alguacil is that his side have failed to score in their last four now.

According to reports from Fichajes.net, Sevilla are monitoring Kiwiorâs situation in London, alongside growing interest from Italy. Kiwior is contracted to Arsenal until 2027, but Arteta could be open to a sale, if it frees up funds to sign an alternative that better suits his tactical system with the Gunners.","Kiwior is contracted to Arsenal until 2027, but Arteta could be open to a sale, if it frees up funds to sign an alternative that better suits his tactical system with the Gunners."

Asked about Shawâs availability ahead of the trip to Kenilworth Road, Ten Hag was cautiously optimistic.

As they approach the final third of the season, it looks as if it is theirs to lose.  Currently, Los Blancos are averaging just over two-and-a-half points per game, which should they maintain it, will take them to 96.5 points for the season. Clearly either it will be one of 97 or 96 at this pace, but it would be enough to edit the record books if they carry on, as Football EspaÃ±a noted on CNN while reviewing the game. The top two record points totals came from Pep Guardiolaâs Barcelona (11-12, 100 points) and Jose Mourinhoâs Real Madrid (12-13, 100 points). Guardiolaâs side also racked up 99 points in 2010, but the other two totals (96) that round out the top five also came from Guardiola and Pellegrini. Carlo Ancelottiâs side stand a good chance at this pace of making it into that top five. Much of the focus this year has been on the failings of their rivals, which are no doubt there, but Los Blancos are accumulating points at an almost impossible rhythm too. The show they put on against Girona was evidence they have plenty more to give too, as they moved five points clear. Image via Oscar J. Barroso / AFP7 / Europa Press",Image via Oscar J.

124,Race for the Scudetto: Inter Milan find way to beat Roma; Juve shocked at home,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Race-for-the-Scudetto-Inter-Milan-find-way-to-beat-Roma-Juve-shocked-at-home/3301637,2 days ago,"Inter turned the turbo on and ran away at the top of the standings, lengthening the distance to +7 over Max Allegri's Juventus. At the moment, Serie A seems over, with the Nerazzurri looking like they are totally on another level. Simone Inzaghi's boys beat Roma 2-4, making the most of the few chances conceded by the Giallorossi. The Bianconeri, on the other hand, lost to Udinese. Let's see what happened...  The most entertaining match of the weekend and probably one of the best of the last period. Daniele De Rossi's Roma has changed its identity, now plays better and is convinced it can go head-to-head against anyone, even against the strongest team in the league. And so it did Saturday afternoon against Inter. In the past, the Giallorossi used to arrive at important matches with a kind of reverential fear, convinced they were not strong enough; De Rossi in less than a month has changed the nature of the Giallorossi team. Saturday afternoon at the Stadio Olimpico, Lorenzo Pellegrini and his teammates played an excellent game, led by the captain and Stephan El Shaarawy, but they were forced to surrender to Inter's talent, at this moment a team simply superior to all the others. The Giallorossi started better, coming close to scoring on two occasions, but Francesco Acerbi found the go-ahead goal in a rather fortunate and fortuitous way. Then a vehement reaction by Roma: a perfect free kick by Pellegrini, Gianluca Mancini finding a header and scored. Shortly afterwards also came the goal for the lead, with a counterattack led by Pellegrini and finished in the best possible way by El Shaarawy, with an incredible shot. Definitely the best Roma of the season in the first 45 minutes. In the second half, however, Inter returned to the pitch more convinced and took advantage of a serious inattention by Bryan Cristante and Leandro Paredes, who were intent on protesting for a free kick in the centre of the pitch: the Nerazzurri quickly took the free kick finding the midfield uncovered and thus came the equaliser. Shortly after came the third, an own goal by Angelino made in an attempt to prevent Marcus Thuram from sending the ball into the net. Late in the game the fourth goal also came, with the counterattack closed by Alessndro Bastoni, but on the 2-3 score Romelu Lukaku had two huge chances to score the equalising goal, but he missed both chances. De Rossi's Roma is growing, Simone Inzaghi's Inter is just too strong for the others. Looking at him now, it seems strange that he could be the same struggling, timid and awkward player seen in the Milan jersey. The Belgian has blossomed under Gian Piero Gasperini's guidance and between goals and assists he is currently taking Atalanta by the hand. The former AC Milan player was one of the best on the field in the Bergamaschi's match against Genoa on Sunday: the first goal was scored by Charles himself, with an incredible shot, stopped with one foot and then finished in the corner with the other. A constant danger for his opponents, a point of reference for Gasperini's men, he is Atalanta's man in the spotlight at the moment, and the credit goes to his coach, who has accomplished yet another masterpiece by regenerating a player who seemed to have been lost. With a De Ketelaere like this and Ademola Lookman returning from the African Cup of Nations, fourth place now seems destined for Atalanta: the other contenders for a Champions League spot will have to produce an incredible run to make up ground. Unbelievable, but true: Juventus may have lost ground for good in the Scudetto race by losing at home, in front of their own fans, to Udinese, the second ranked team to have won fewer games in the league, only three. A great opportunity missed by the Bianconeri, who despite already knowing the result of Roma-Inter managed the feat of losing. Without Dusan Vlahovic, Max Allegri trusted Fede Chiesa and Arek Milik, but the two strikers heavily and severely betrayed their coach's expectations, playing a very poor game. Every Juventus player was guilty, however, this must be said: Rabiot, Locatelli, McKennie, Bremer, Chiesa, Weah, Milik, are all top players, but were unable to get the better of a team in great difficulty like Udinese. Certainly Allegri's teams don't play attacking football and do not allow the most talented players to put all their technical qualities on the field, but some matches should be won even if only through experience. Of course, due credit must be given to the boys coached by Lele Cioffi, who thanks to Lautaro Giannetti's goal produced a real masterpiece and momentarily were out of the hot zone of the standings. Bravo Udinese, but dear Juventus, this is not good enough.","Certainly Allegri's teams don't play attacking football and do not allow the most talented players to put all their technical qualities on the field, but some matches should be won even if only through experience.

Much of the focus was on Toni Kroos, who returned to his homeland amid speculation over whether he would return again in the summer to play for the national team. He was the protagonist on and off the pitch, but as usual, handled it all with typical composure and a streak of dry wit.  Before the match Kroos admitted he was considering coming out of retirement for Germany, while also saying he did not know whether he would extend his deal with Real Madrid deal. He also opined on the stick he got from fans in Saudi Arabia during the Spanish Supercup last month. It was Kroos who took care of the press duties from the players side, and as he passed Carlo Ancelotti who was on the way to do his press conference, he had the Italian going for a moment with his humour.","It was Kroos who took care of the press duties from the players side, and as he passed Carlo Ancelotti who was on the way to do his press conference, he had the Italian going for a moment with his humour."

However, at least according to city rivals Getafe, Mbappe wonât be playing at the Santiago Bernabeu next season, but rather at the Coliseum, as has been âannouncedâ in a post on X. Unfortunately for Getafe, they can only dream of signing Mbappe, although he is highly likely to be playing at their Coliseum stadium next season, albeit in the famous white jersey of Real Madrid instead. There is certainly a large amount of anticipation building, especially among Real Madrid supporters, for Mbappeâs expected arrival. Itâs moment that has been several years in the making, but it will surely be worth the wait.","There is certainly a large amount of anticipation building, especially among Real Madrid supporters, for Mbappeâs expected arrival.

127,"EPL TITLE RACE: Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal are separated by two points",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/EPL-TITLE-RACE-Liverpool-Man-City-and-Arsenal-are-separated-by-two-points/3300886,12 Feb,"The Premier League title race looks to be one of the most hotly-contested in history, with three sides who all look more than capable of lifting the trophy on May 19.  Manchester City are once again hitting their stride with Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne back on form. Liverpool meanwhile will be looking to end the Jurgen Klopp era on a high and win the title in front of fans to give him the best possible send-off. There have been fears whether Arsenal have enough firepower compared to their rivals, though the Gunners sent a real statement of intent with their 6-0 demolition of West Ham. Man City are still to travel to Anfield and play Arsenal at the Emirates, while all three sides play Tottenham in consecutive games towards the latter stages of the season. With that in mind, Mail Sport takes a look at the run-in of what looks to be the first true three-horse race in years - while also keeping an eye on Tottenham to see if they could also get themselves involved.  Gameweek 25 The title contenders continue their relentless form with all three picking up impressive victories in the next weekend of fixtures. Manchester City - inspired by an on-song Haaland - put in the most impressive performance of the weekend with a 4-1 victory over Chelsea - piling more pressure on the struggling Blues and their manager Mauricio Pochettino. The Gunners make light work on the road again but only score half the amount of goals that they did against West Ham, when they face relegation-threatened Burnley. Liverpool meanwhile make another slow start away at Brentford, with the Bees taking the lead through Ivan Toney. Their expansive array of attacking options though proves too much for Thomas Frank's side, with Diogo Jota, Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz all netting again. Tottenham keep the gap to the top at seven points with a hard-fought victory over Wolves. Brentford 1-3 Liverpool Burnley 0-3 Arsenal Tottenham 2-1 Wolves Man City 4-1 Chelsea  Gameweek 26 Going into Gameweek 26, Man City take the lead in the title race with a comfortable victory over Brentford with their game-in-hand. Liverpool briefly take top-spot back as they see off Luton in their final game before they play Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final - with Mohamed Salah starting his first game since the victory over Newcastle at the beginning of January. Dominic Solanke gives City a scare by netting the opener for Bournemouth, but Guardiola's side ultimately have too much fire-power for the Cherries and re-take the top spot. Meanwhile there is tricky matches for both north London sides with Arsenal hosting Newcastle and Tottenham visiting bitter rivals Chelsea. Arsenal snatch a late winner against the Magpies, while Chelsea up their game in a fiery contest at Stamford Bridge to take two points off Ange Postecoglou's side. Man City 3-0 Brentford Liverpool 3-0 Luton Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham Bournemouth 1-3 Man City Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle  Gameweek 27 Man City make it 10 wins in a row as they see off a resurgent Manchester United in the local derby at the Etihad Stadium. But the two sides below them continue to keep up their relentless hunt of the champions with comfortable victories over Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United respectively. Tottenham meanwhile return to winning ways with a 3-1 win over Crystal Palace, but need a miracle to get themselves back into title contention. Nottingham Forest 0-2 Liverpool Tottenham 3-1 Crystal Palace Man City 3-1 Man United Sheffield United 0-2 Arsenal Gameweek 28 There is a new team at the top of the table as Jurgen Klopp gets the better of Pep Guardiola in their final Premier League outing against each other. Salah scores his first goal since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations and injury to give the Reds the lead only for Haaland to equalise. But it's on-form Jota who proves to be the match-winner and send the Reds two points clear at the top of the standings. A draw would have been better for Arsenal, though Mikel Arteta's side make it eight league wins on the bounce and they are still within range to pounce on any dropped points from the sides above them. Tottenham's title chances seem to be all but over however after they drop two vital points away at Villa Park - with Unai Emery's side still holding hopes of a top-four spot. Arsenal 3-1 Brentford Aston Villa 1-1 Tottenham Liverpool 2-1 Man City  Gameweek 29 Frustration for Liverpool fans as after picking up what could be a season-defining win they drop points in the Merseyside derby. Sean Dyche successfully annoys Klopp in the German's last meeting against Liverpool's local rivals - with the Reds held to a 1-1 draw. Manchester City meanwhile appear to be rattled from their defeat last weekend, and they have more points taken off them by an impressive Brighton side - even if the reigning champions are able to salvage what could prove a vital point. Arsenal meanwhile make it three different teams to top the standings in as many weeks, as they see off Chelsea 2-0 at the Emirates. That's now nine wins on the bounce for Arsenal, who next play an off-form Man City at the Etihad. Arsenal 2-0 Chelsea Fulham 0-3 Tottenham Everton 1-1 Liverpool Brighton 2-2 Man City  Gameweek 30 Just two weeks after perhaps the biggest game of the season between Liverpool and Man City, we have another with the reigning champions in need of a victory after taking one point in their last six. Arsenal are the on-form side going into the contest but they fail to take their chances and are punished in the second-half by Man City - and the Gunners drop from first to third. Liverpool, after one week off the top, overcome Brighton in a five-goal thriller as their attacking fire-power again prevails despite some deficiencies in defence. Tottenham meanwhile are now nine points off the top after back-to-back wins over Fulham and Luton. Tottenham 2-0 Luton Liverpool 3-2 Brighton Man City 1-0 Arsenal   Gameweek 31 A bit more of a settled week at the top of the standings, with Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal all prevailing. Liverpool get a huge boost to their goal difference which could prove to be the determining factor over where the title goes at the end of the season - with a 5-0 win over Sheffield United. Arsenal have a slow start against Luton but score two second-half goals to take three points. While Man City get revenge for their defeat at Villa Park earlier this season, with a 1-0 win over Unai Emery's side - who are by now off the pace in the top-four hunt. Arsenal 2-0 Luton West Ham 1-3 Tottenham Liverpool 5-0 Sheffield United Man City 2-0 Aston Villa Gameweek 32 Liverpool are yet again frustrated by one of their biggest rivals, as they are held to a 1-1 draw away at Old Trafford - in a game reflecting their result with the same scoreline against Everton. Man City, who have been off the top since Gameweek 27, are back in front after they smash Crystal Palace 4-1 with Haaland netting a hat-trick. However, they are only ahead of Liverpool on goals scored with 79 compared to 75. Arsenal look like they will be frustrated with a 2-2 draw at Brighton, much like the Seagulls did to Man City. But Declan Rice scores another late winner to help them keep the pace with the sides above them. Meanwhile, Tottenham are now just seven points off the top after a dominant home win against Nottingham Forest. Their next four fixtures however are Newcastle away, Man City and Arsenal at home, and Liverpool away. Brighton 2-3 Arsenal Crystal Palace 1-4 Man City Man United 1-1 Liverpool Tottenham 4-0 Nottingham Forest  Gameweek 33 No change at the top as Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal all take victories. Man City and Liverpool cruise to victories against Luton and Crystal Palace respectively, with the former now ahead in terms of goal difference. Arsenal are involved in another five-goal thriller, and again come out victorious this time against Aston Villa at the Emirates. Tottenham's resurgence is halted away at Newcastle - who are showing improvements with a mostly fit squad to choose from finally. Arsenal 3-2 Aston Villa Liverpool 3-0 Crystal Palace Man City 5-0 Luton Newcastle 2- 1 Tottenham Gameweek 34 Now starts a run of games where Tottenham could influence the outcome of the title race. First up, they welcome Manchester City, having held an impressive record against Guardiola's side at home in recent seasons. However, City have learnt from their past lessons and overcome the acid test to their title defence with a 2-1 victory. Liverpool struggle away at Fulham but still have enough to take a 2-1 victory. But Arsenal suffer a huge dent to their title hopes as they are held to a 2-2 draw by Wolves led by an inspired Pedro Neto. Arsenal now go into a game against Tottenham which has become a must-win for their title chances. Fulham 1-2 Liverpool Tottenham 1-2 Man City Wolves 2-2 Arsenal  Gameweek 35 Arsenal's title challenge looks all but over and it is thanks to their biggest rivals as Tottenham take a 2-1 victory to leave the Gunners six points off the top - with three games to play. The Gunners have the better of the chances but fail to put them away and the need for a striker becomes ever more clear. Man City's 5-1 victory over Nottingham Forest is even more significant as it gives them a huge boost in terms of goal difference over Liverpool - who could only net two in a win away at West Ham. Nottingham Forest 1-5 Man City Tottenham 2-1 Arsenal West Ham 0-2 Liverpool  Gameweek 36 Liverpool are the next side lined up with the challenge of overcoming Tottenham. Their defeat by Spurs earlier in the campaign is one of the biggest talking-points of the season, and could be the game that costs them the title. But regardless they make no mistake this time putting away Tottenham as their narrow 1-0 win keeps them hot on the heels of Man City who come from behind to beat Wolves. Arsenal bounce back from their back-to-back games without a victory with a 5-1 thrashing against Bournemouth but it seems too-little too-late for the Gunners who need both sides ahead of them to lose their final two games. Arsenal 5-1 Bournemouth Liverpool 1-0 Tottenham Man City 3-2 Wolves Gameweek 37 The title-race drops down to two teams as Arsenal's 2-0 victory over Manchester United is not enough to keep them in the hunt. They have a glimmer of hope with Aston Villa and Fulham making Liverpool and Man City work hard away from home - with both sides having their chances to take a victory over the title contenders. Both Liverpool and Man City are able to score winners deep into the second-half though meaning that again we are going down to the final game of the season between the two sides. The Reds have lost the title by one point twice to City in the last five years, could this be the year they finally prevail over City? Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool Fulham 0-1 Man City Man United 0-2 Arsenal Tottenham 4-0 Burnley Gameweek 38 Liverpool do not get the fairytale ending in the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp, as both sides win on the final day - with City taking the title on goal difference. The Reds run rampant against Wolves knowing that it will go down to goal difference, and West Ham bag a goal against Man City which offers a small glimmer of hope. But ultimately, City's goal difference of +60 compared to Liverpool's +58 is enough to win them the title with Liverpool having to rely on other trophies to give Klopp some silverware to finish off with. Arsenal and Tottenham round out the top four, with the Gunners disappointed to miss out for the second season in a row with their lack of fire-power proving decisive in games where they dropped points against City, Wolves and Tottenham.   Arsenal 4-2 Everton Liverpool 4-0 Wolves Man City 3-1 West Ham Sheff United 0-2 Tottenham",Sheff United 0-2 Tottenham
128,Kylian Mbappe helps Paris St Germain take charge of Real Sociedad tie,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kylian-Mbappe-helps-Paris-St-Germain-take-charge-of-Real-Sociedad-tie/3302033,1 day ago,"Kylian Mbappe opened the scoring as Paris St Germain recorded a 2-0 last-16 first leg victory over Real Sociedad in the Champions League. The Ligue 1 champions took control of the tie with two second-half goals at Parc Des Princes. Mbappe struck in the 58th minute before Bradley Barcolaâs 70th-minute strike gave the Parisians an aggregate advantage ahead of the return leg in March. Sociedad almost took the lead in the first half. Brais Mendez whipped in a free-kick which tested the PSG defence before Andre Silva failed to score from close range. After Alex Remiro denied Mbappe, the LaLiga club went close again with a double effort from Takefusa Kubo. The Japan international cut in from the right-hand side of the box and curved an effort towards the back post, but the winger put too much power on the strike and it sailed wide of the target. After the break Sociedad looked likely to land the first blow but Mendez was denied by the crossbar. The creative Mendez fired a powerful strike from range but his effort cannoned off the upright to keep the scores level. The visitorsâ lack of clinical edge proved costly when Mbappe scored from close-range to give his side the lead just before the hour mark. France Soccer Champions League  Ousmane Dembeleâs curved corner saw Marquinhos flick the ball on into the path of the dangerous Mbappe, evading his marker to score. And in the 69th minute Mbappe looked likely to add another. The striker cut inside on to his favoured right foot and narrowly missed the right post, much to the relief of Remiro who was well-beaten. But just one minute later PSG double their lead and took full control of the contest. Fabian Ruiz showed off his skills with a deft through ball before the deadly Barcola drove into the box and finished cutely to confirm the win.",Fabian Ruiz showed off his skills with a deft through ball before the deadly Barcola drove into the box and finished cutely to confirm the win.
129,Man United & Newcastle expected to reach agreement over Ashworth early NEXT WEEK,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-United--Newcastle-expected-to-reach-agreement-over-Ashworth-early-NEXT-WEEK/3301806,2 days ago,"Manchester United and Newcastle are expected to reach an agreement over Dan Ashworth by early next week, Mail Sport understands.  A formal approach from Man United is being prepared for the sporting director and a swift conclusion is the preference of all parties. Ashworth wants to swap St Jamesâ Park for Old Trafford and, if a compensation package is agreed, there will be movement in the coming days. The 52-year-old is seen as the best in the business by incoming Man United co-owner Sir Dave Brailsford, and the focus of his remit would be recruitment. Ashworth has not had as much control as he expected at Newcastle, the club he joined in the summer of 2022. There has been no fallout but it is thought the lure of the project at Man United, and his relationship with Brailsford, has persuaded him the time is right to move on.","There has been no fallout but it is thought the lure of the project at Man United, and his relationship with Brailsford, has persuaded him the time is right to move on."
130,MAN UNITED CONFIDENTIAL: Inside the scramble to sign Jarrad Branthwaite,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/MAN-UNITED-CONFIDENTIAL-Inside-the-scramble-to-sign-Jarrad-Branthwaite/3301310,13 Feb,"Manchester United and Tottenham are pushing more than most ahead of an transfer scramble for Jarrad Branthwaite this summer.  While Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid have all enquired about the 21-year-old, Confidential understands that it is United and Spurs that are making the most concerted effort at this stage. It is understood United are looking to bring in two young centre backs this summer as INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe get their first chance of improving Erik ten Hag's side in the transfer market. Homegrown players are going to be a key focus and Branthwaite appeals given he is a left-sided centre back, something Ten Hag is seeking in a bid to have better balance across the defence. There is not tunnel vision on Branthwaite, though, with United keeping in contact over centre backs such as Benfica's Antonio Silva, Jean-Clair Todibo at Nice, and Lille's 18-year-old Leny Yoro, who has caught Real Madrid's eye.   But it is Branthwaite that stands as a primary target ahead of the summer. The size of any offer come the end of the season will likely hinge on Everton's league status, with the Toffees currently 18th in the Premier League with 19 points following a points deduction earlier this season. Not that United need much convincing but should they be out seeking referrals, the England youngster was once described by his former mentor and coach Ruud van Nistelrooy - who spent five years leading the line for Man United - as 'complete' from their time working together at PSV Eindhoven. Elsewhere in the transfer market, Wolves' Pedro Neto has come up in conversations, as well as Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. Alejandro Garnacho has revelled in his new right wing role but with concerns over the form of Antony and both Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood shipped out on loan, Ten Hag is short of options on that side should anything happen to Garnacho. Neto is being shopped around ahead of an anticipated summer move, with Man City, Arsenal and Newcastle other potential landing spots if the interest is there. SOCCER AID SNUB Old Trafford will not be hosting this summer's Soccer Aid as officials consider which works to carry out during the off-season. A decision is expected on how to deal with the historic issue of the leaky roof in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, while renovation work will need to be carried out on the pitch.  The situation with the roof is a tricky one. A long-term fix would be a substantial project and would be likely to involve the use of cranes. That would in turn need the railway line behind the stand to be closed for certain time periods. With soon-to-be 25 per cent investors INEOS considering whether to refurbish Old Trafford or build a new, state-of-the-art home on the existing site, it remains to be seen whether such a large-scale project would be viewed as a worthwhile investment. United have hosted the annual Soccer Aid fundraiser, which sees celebs and ex-players face off and has raised close to Â£40m for children's charity UNICEF, eight times in the past. However, a switch from Old Trafford is not unusual, with Stamford Bridge, the Etihad Stadium and the London Stadium all used in previous years. Chelsea's home is expected to stage the fixture, which will take place on June 9.  MAINOO IN NO RUSH Kobbie Mainoo's breakthrough into United's first team has seen a clamour from fans to see a new deal fast-tracked â but there is no rush from the midfielder's side. Confidential understands there is a calmness in Mainoo's camp over any new deal, with the plan to continue to let the 18-year-old develop in Erik ten Hag's side for the time being. Mainoo only signed his most recent deal in February 2023 and that runs until June 2027. It also includes the option of a further year. That means there is no panic or rush to get back to the negotiating table before the end of the season. He has cemented himself as one of the first names on the team sheet for Ten Hag and is highly thought of in a dressing room full of experienced internationals.  'We have a generational talent in Kobbie Mainoo,' Rasmus Hojlund said earlier this season. 'You can see his composure, he is so relaxed on the ball. Now he's also starting to show that he has the scoring part of his game as well. He's a complete player.' A lucrative new deal is inevitable but the message for now: keep calm and carry on. MARY EARPS COULD STAY While it had seemed that Mary Earps was destined to leave Manchester United in the summer, it appears the goalkeeper may not be as close to the exit door as many think. Earps is out of contract in the summer and has attracted interest from a number of clubs, but Confidential understands that United remain in the running to secure her long-term future. Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona are both understood to have held an interest in Earps but a move to either club could prove tricky. PSG's three international spots, reserved for players outside of the EU, are full, while Barca's priority is to sign a striker and a defender in the next window.  Earps, who was the subject of a record bid from Arsenal last summer, did not express a desire to leave United in the January transfer window and has remained professional despite the uncertainty around her future. While the goalkeeper may remain at United beyond this season, Confidential understands that Earps, 30, will end her sponsorship with adidas at the end of the campaign â which could bring about a bidding war from rival kit manufacturers. CASEMIRO JOINS NIKE EXODUS Speaking of adidas, they have managed to snare Casemiro from Nike this week after a career-long association with the American sports giant. The Brazilian had been wearing Nike since his professional debut but was seen at Villa Park wearing adidas Predators, who he is now an ambassador for. Nike announced late last year that they are trying to save $2billion over the next three years and that has seen plenty of top Premier League stars land lucrative deals elsewhere. In 2023, Lisandro Martinez swapped Nike for adidas, while Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane, as well as Man City trio Jack Grealish, Mateo Kovacic and Manuel Akanji, all separated from Nike in the past 12 months.  STANDARDS SET BY SCOTT When Erik ten Hag said he 'loves' Scott McTominay in the wake of his match-winning goal at Aston Villa, he meant it. The Scot refuses to get carried away and in a bid to set the standards for team-mates he was one of the first out on the grass on Monday morning for a gruelling two-hour recovery session at Carrington. It is always a tough session for the players who didn't start as they work to get a 'match load' in their legs. Benni McCarthy ran a shooting session where players were made to sprint between stations, take on defenders before having to switch roles. Confidential understands that it was McTominay setting the standard in that session, leaving Ten Hag with even more reason to smile about his in-form super sub.  FAN BACKLASH - BUT CONTROVERSIAL POLICY SET TO END A backlash towards United's ticketing changes for next season has grown after the wife of a club legend waded into the row. United are relocating a block of season-ticket holders in the Sir Bobby Charlton stand to accommodate executive seating. One fan affected is Norman Whiteside, a two-time FA Cup winner who scored 67 goals in 274 games for the club. He has his name on his seat at Old Trafford, in block S122, as a result of having a ticket for 25 years but does not yet know where he will be next season. His wife, Dee, called the decision an 'absolute disgrace' in a post on X. In response, United said: 'We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations. 'We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.'  United are, however, set to bring an end to a controversial policy as a result of the move. Fans have regularly criticised the club for selling seats online in general admission areas of the stadium for up to 10 times the value of the ticket, with the promise of off-site hospitality, including at the Old Trafford cricket ground. It led to some supporters accusing United of touting tickets to their own fans, which the club deny. But sources accepted the move of all off-site executive seating to one area of the Sir Bobby Charlton stand would prevent this issue and claim it could help eradicate ticket touting. UP FOR THE CUP In better news, United have had reduced away allocations for several matches already this season, but have successfully fought a plan to cut the number of seats for their FA Cup trip to Nottingham Forest. Forest had given United 4,200 tickets, 200 seats fewer than the club were entitled to under FA Cup rules, which state visiting teams should be allocated 15 per cent of the stadium's capacity. The City Ground holds around 30,000. Club officials challenged the decision and Forest agreed to release the extra tickets for the clash on February 28. United were given a reduced allocation for the league game at Forest in December following an incident during the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final last year when the advertising hoardings collapsed under pressure from jubilant supporters after Ten Hag's men scored their third goal.  UNITED'S HALF CENTURY United's trip to Luton on Sunday will be their first in the Premier League representing the 50th club they have played away in the competition. But while the Kenilworth Road venue may be new in the modern era, there will be an old familiar face to greet them. Mick Harford, now a Luton scout and still a regular attendee at Hatters home games, was a proper thorn in United's side in the old First Division days. He scored against them in 1987 - still Luton's last win against United - and again in 1992 in their last league meeting in Bedfordshire when the game finished 1-1. It's doubtful Rob Edwards' current Luton players will celebrate like Harford and his pals did, being dragged around the Irish bars in the town by team-mate Ashley Grimes - who ironically began his English league career at Old Trafford.  U18s INVINCIBLE DREAM Derby County may have become the first team to slow down United's U18s juggernaut but their invincible dream lives on. Twice coming back from behind, a 2-2 draw stretches their unbeaten run to 15 games - 14 wins, 1 draw. While there has been such rich success of Carrington graduates in the first team - academy graduates have contributed to more than 25 per cent of first team minutes this season - the next generation are giving plenty of reasons for coaches to be excited. A key part of the focus in the U18s has been to keep the average age down, with lots of younger players cutting their teeth above their age group. Academy director Nick Cox has seen 32 different players used, lots of the U16s given a chance and it's worked with 48 goals scored, only 12 conceded and they are running away from rivals at the top of the table.  It's also been a talking point around Carrington this week just how much emphasis is being put on these youngsters' education off the pitch. This week there has been a big focus around children's mental health week, with plenty of workshops put on for kids and parents. With the pressure sky high for these players to try and make the grade in the first team, a newsletter has been sent out every day to all academy staff guiding them on how to support themselves, each other and all of the young players. PLUNKETT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE Eagle-eyed followers of the academy noticed a new name on the Under-18s team-sheet at the weekend, U16 full-back Dante Plunkett. Confidential can confirm the full-back, who was previously on the books at Aston Villa, is on trial with United as coaches take the chance to get a closer look at him. Meanwhile, Sheffield United's teenage goalkeeper Luke Faxon is attracting interest from United. The Blades have offered him a long term deal but United, Liverpool and Manchester City are all interested in him. One to watch. RIDE OF A LIFETIME For a journey that started on May 5, 2023, in rural Mongolia, a United-mad fan is closing in on making it all the way to Manchester - by BIKE. Ochiroo Batbold, a footballer in the Mongolian Premier League, has been on the road for nine months and has covered more than 13,000km on his bike on his mission to make it all the way from his home in Ulaanbaatar to Old Trafford. His latest pit-stop took him to Austria, with Germany and France left to tick off before arriving in England. An incredible effort. MICKEY'S BOOST One of the most popular characters behind the scenes on a Man United match day is undoubtedly the boisterous Mickey Thomas. And so there were plenty smiling from ear to ear when he received great news on his latest CT scan, getting the all clear again with no signs of his cancer returning. Thomas was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2019 but has fought hard to work his way back to health. 'I will soon hit the 5 year landmark of winning my battle. Thinking of all those people just starting on their personal journey. Keep positive - Keep Fighting,' he posted on X. ",

The France captain has always made no mystery of his desire to feature in the Olympic Games in his home city as Paris prepares to host sportâs biggest event from July 26 to August 11. On Sunday, the Argentina U-23 team booked its ticket for the Olympic tournament held in France courtesy of their 1-0 win against double gold medallists Brazil.  Speaking to the media, former Liverpool and Barcelona defensive midfielder Javier Mascherano, now the manager of Argentinaâs youth team, has revealed he was very keen on bringing Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria to the Paris Olympic Games football tournament, whose final will be held at PSGâs Parc des Princes. âWell, everyone knows my relationship with Leo and my friendship with himâ, Mascherano said to Reuters. âA player like Leo has opened doors and the invitation to accompany us then will obviously depend on him, his compromises and his time, but the invitation clearly stands.â National teams taking part in the Olympic Gamesâ football tournament are allowed three overage players in their squad. Messi has already won an Olympic tournament alongside Di Maria â it was sixteen years ago for the 2008 Beijing games. However, Di Maria stated that he intends to conclude his international career after the 2024 Copa America held this summer â a tournament Messi is also expected to feature in with Lionel Scaloniâs senior squad. Besides, the Olympics football tournament is no part of the FIFA calendar, meaning Messi and Di Mariaâs respective clubs â Inter Miami and SL Benfica â may veto their participation to the Games. âThey earn the right to decide whatâs best for themâ, Mascherano adds. âBut itâs obvious weâll try to invite them and weâll see.

Could Manchester United qualify for the Champions League?  That is the question the club's fans are asking now following Sunday's 2-1 win at Aston Villa, and with fifth place potentially enough for a spot at European football's revamped top table next season, Erik ten Hag's side are suddenly right in the mix. Villa are still five points above them, but with 14 games of the season left, and other clubs above them in sight too, then it is no wonder than optimism is suddenly rising around Old Trafford. We asked our team what they make of it all. Unbeaten in 2024, with five wins in six games, Manchester United are starting to look like a winning machine again. Thatâs not to say they have become trophy challengers again. They clearly now have the jump on faltering Aston Villa in terms of form, but there is one underlying issue that means Spurs, or Villa, will pip them to fourth place. Despite an upturn this year, Unitedâs Premier League âs goalscoring record is so poor, and not one that guarantees a long range tilt at top four. Just 33 goals. Everyone else in the top seven is in the 50s. Maybe Rasmus Hojlund is finding his touch, and while they have Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford too, all are stuck on five goals in the league. You don't finish top four with Scott McTominay as your top marksman. He's currently on just seven goals. Two lucky wins, in which they had to survive 45 goal attempts, doesn't make Manchester United Champions League material. They were flattered by a 3-0 win against West Ham, and pinned back in their own half for long periods at Aston Villa on Sunday, so spare us the propaganda that Erik ten Hag is a genius. He still doesn't know his best central defensive partnership and he's still more likely to get a tune out of a subway busker than Â£85million enigma Antony. Let's put it this way: If United had to play at Tottenham, Brighton or Brentford tomorrow, would you back them to win? If the answer is 'No' in one, two or all three instances, then a top-four finish is likely to be beyond them. United teams built on conviction would go to those places and dominate the ball, swarm all over their opponents and take away most of the points. As for going to Anfield, the Etihad or the Emirates... don't even think about it. After 18 months of Ten Hag, we still don't know whether United are best when they press high or sit deep - and nor, by the looks of it, does he. So Champions League football at Old Trafford next season? If there are only four places up for grabs, the chances are slim and none. And slim is out of town right now. The top four, in my opinion, will end up being made up of Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. That means Manchester United will be relying on the Premier League, sneaking a fifth Champions League slot. There are extra places available for next seasonâs new-look competition and at the start of the season it looked like a shoo-in for English clubs to get a fifth slot. But United crashing out in the group stage did no-one any favours - especially themselves. However, if City and Arsenal go deep into the knockout stages then all is not lost. And I fancy United to push Aston Villa very close for fifth. United have been a streaky team all season. They go on good runs - Erik ten Hag was Manager of the Month in November, for goodness sake - and then get derailed with one bad result. But if you look at their next seven games, they only face one opponent who is above them: Manchester City. If you wanna get into Europe they have to expect to beat Luton, Fulham, Everton, Sheffield United, Brentford and Chelsea. I think United will sneak into the Champions League by the skin of their teeth. Letâs not get ahead of ourselves. Yes, Manchester United have won three Premier League games in a row. But they still donât look anything like the real deal â and they still rely on Scott McTominay to score crucial late headers to win. United have scored 33 goals in 24 league games this season â the same number as Luton and Fulham. Rasmus Hojlund has found form, scoring five in his last five, but they canât be pinning their hopes on a 21-year-old rookie striker. There is a distinct lack of strength in depth in key positions, which is sure to come back to bite them in the run-in. All that said, they could well close the gap to the top four in the next month, with matches against Luton, Fulham and Nottingham Forest on the horizon. But if weâve learned anything from the Erik ten Hag era, it is that there have been many false dawns before. When it comes to the crunch, I am not backing United to come up clutch. Yes, but only if qualification extends to the fifth place. Manchester United arenât going to catch the top three - forget that - so youâre talking about fourth or fifth place to qualify for the Champions League. With potentially four more games in the FA Cup, Erik ten Hagâs players arenât going to be over-worked, so theyâll stay relatively fresh. I think that will matter because a few of them are still in their first full season - Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo - for instance, so that will help. Their problems are at the back with Lisandro Martinezâs absence. Villa should have earned themselves a point and Ten Hagâs side got out of jail at Molineux. Who are they going to overhaul? It was a big weekend for Spurs. I think theyâll nab fourth but Utd might sneak fifth from Villa who are struggling themselves defensively. If Unai Emery loses Ollie Watkins, Villa will be hard pushed to keep their momentum. So, a tentative âyesâ but they still look miles off the pace set by the top three. Every so often there are moments when you're watching football matches, even passively, when you wonder if you're witnessing the same game the coaches are. Unai Emery is a brilliant manager who has done a superb job at Aston Villa, but how on earth he looked at Leon Bailey enjoying a generous helping of Victor Lindelof on toast and decided to change it is beyond me. Sunday's game altered there, and while credit should go to Erik ten Hag for picking his moment - something United have been good at in recent years regardless of their manager or their struggles - it still felt a bit more like Villa tripping themselves up than anything the visitors did to impact the game. United still don't convince you that they can do that on a consistent basis, and I'd still say Villa are a more cohesive side than them, while I'm happy to back Tottenham and their calm, cool culture imposed by Big Ange to come fourth. In the Premier League's zero sum game that leaves United sixth, and on the balance of what we've seen so far that table wouldn't lie. After 24 Premier League matches, Manchester United have a goal difference of zero and you have to go as far down as 13th-placed Bournemouth to find a team that has scored fewer. So, letâs not get carried away by a run of three victories, the last of which was a slightly unlikely one against an Aston Villa team who dominated large parts of the game. But leaving aside a trip to the Etihad at the beginning of next month, United have a series of very winnable fixtures immediately ahead of them. Six of their next seven Premier League games are against teams below them in the table. But while there has been distinct improvement in this United team, is it better than Villa and Spurs, the sides above Eric ten Hagâs sixth-placed men? The answer, quite simply, is no. And that is why there will be no Champions League football at Old Trafford next season. I think Manchester United will finish fifth. Itâs unclear at this stage whether that will be enough for the Red Devils to qualify for the Champions League, but I canât see anyone forcing Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City out of the top four. Although Aston Villa sit one point off Spurs in fourth, they have endured a drop off in form of late, having won two of their last seven Premier League fixtures. With European football set to come back in the next month, I fear that Villa are going to slump down the table. This would leave a gap for United to jump into. Erik ten Hagâs side sit sixth, five points behind Villa but they have won their last three league matches and are hitting form at a good time. They are also not in Europe and face much less disruption compared to Villa. If United can keep Rasmus Hojlund fit and firing, then I have no doubt they will finish fifth. With five goals in his last five matches, he is that important at the moment. Meanwhile, Newcastle are five points worse off than United in seventh, but I feel that they arenât consistent enough both offensively and defensively to challenge the top six. I think the Magpies will finish seventh, with Chelsea eighth, Brighton ninth and West Ham in 10th. United have gathered some momentum but I still think they have given themselves too much to do - even if five Premier League teams qualify for the Champions League. Erik ten Hagâs team are really grinding out the results at the moment and three successive wins have got the Old Trafford fans excited again. But performances have to improve significantly if the Reds are going to nudge ahead of Aston Villa and Tottenham in the final Premier League table. United are relying too much on individual moments of genuine quality at the moment. Until they start to dominate games from start to finish then they remain outsiders, in my opinion. United have a couple of âwinnableâ games approaching, but at the moment it wouldnât be a surprise if they dropped points at Luton or at home to Fulham. Until that stops then they canât be considered serious contenders for Champions League qualification. There are two ways of looking at this. The fact Scott McTominay has become Manchester Unitedâs unlikely saviour is testament to Erik ten Hagâs ability to resurrect once unsalvageable careers, and isnât that the DNA of a Champions-League qualifying team? McTominayâs game-winning header against Aston Villa was not only the latest episode in the Scotland internationalâs redemption arc but evidence of Unitedâs ability to find ways to win. Also: Manchester United + super-subs = winning! The other way of looking at this is Unitedâs undying reliance on McTominay to pop up with crucial goals (his seven goals have given Ten Hagâs side an additional 12 points, the most by any player in the Premier League, without which United would be stewing in 12th) points to a raft of weaknesses. Once again, United failed to kill off a match, succumbing to a lack of control and needing to overload the box late on to save themselves. If they are to bridge the gap to the top five, that habit needs fixing, and fast. Until then, itâs apparently super-sub Scott McTominay to the rescue. United's hopes of Champions League football next term rest on how many places English clubs are granted in the next edition of the competition. If it's four, I think Erik ten Hag's men will come up short, given three are almost certainly going to be occupied by Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. The idea of United managing to leapfrog BOTH Tottenham and Aston Villa between now and May is far-fetched given their own defensive frailties. However, if a fifth-placed Champions League qualification then United could sneak in. Spurs have a history of struggling to hold their nerve, while Arsenal fans will confirm Unai Emery's record when the going gets tough and the stakes are high isn't fantastic either.","However, if a fifth-placed Champions League qualification then United could sneak in.

134,Comparing every Premier League clubâs wage bill to its 2023-24 league position,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Comparing-every-Premier-League-club%E2%80%99s-wage-bill-to-its-2023-24-league-position/3298882,11 Feb,"Manchester United and Chelsea are among the Premier Leagueâs biggest underperformers when you stack up their position in the 2023-24 table to their wage bill.  How much every club spends on wages has always strongly correlated with how the table ends up in the end, although clubs like Brighton and Brentford have done spectacularly well to punch above their weight in recent years â and they continue to do so at the start of this season. Brightonâs wage bill has crept up steadily as theyâve made major steps forward but with an annual outlay of just Â£62million they still sit just 14th in terms of Premier League wages. Roberto De Zerbi has the Seagulls sitting pretty up in eighth, above the likes of Chelsea who spend several times over what they do on player wages. Tottenham, Wolves, Bournemouth and even Luton â relative to their outlay â are among the other clubs overachieving at this stage of the 2023-24 campaign, while Everton sit below Chelsea and Manchester United at the other end of the scale. However, this is taking into account their 10-point deduction. The newly-promoted clubs are all more-or-less where youâd expect them to be. Likewise, Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal are up in the European spots as they ought to be. Of course, thereâs still plenty of the race left to run and youâd expect the table to take further shape in due course.

136,Mahrez's wife Taylor Ward reveals what living in Saudi Arabia is REALLY like,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mahrezs-wife-Taylor-Ward-reveals-what-living-in-Saudi-Arabia-is-REALLY-like/3301133,13 Feb,"Riyad Mahrez's move to Saudi Arabia last summer was a big shock for football fans but no-one was stunned more than his wife, model and influencer Taylor Ward.  The 26-year-old, who is the daughter of Real House of Cheshire star Dawn and former Premier League player Ashley, went viral after a clip for her new documentary showed Mahrez's blunt reaction to her shock when finding out she was set to move to Saudi Pro League club Al-Ahli. Ward said she was 'overwhelmed' when Mahrez informed her they would be leaving Man City and moving to Jeddah at short notice, with the winger telling her: 'It's part of the game, innit,' after she had expressed concern that she would be 'sat at home on my own'. That moment will be documented in the upcoming Prime Video show Married to the Game, which is also set to detail the couple's move to Saudi and show how they've since settled into the country. Other wives and girlfriends of footballers will exhibit their own lifestyles in subsequent episodes. Ward admitted Mahrez's response to her 'still haunts me', but said the Algerian player was 'straight-talking' and 'to the point' as she opened up on the 'emotional rollercoaster' while speaking to Mail Sport.   'That line haunts me,' she said, as she explained that a clip of her crying was after a sitdown with her sister later on. 'I keep seeing it on social media. That whole week was just an emotional rollercoaster really. It was a huge shock and I had absolutely no idea. One day we were planning for Riyad to go back to pre-season with City and then overnight we were moving to Saudi and I was planning this whole move. 'I think it was just very overwhelming at the time and a massive shock because I just didn't see it coming at all. That scene with Riyad - that is just him to a tee. He is just straight talking and to the point. He is very much just like, ""it is what it is, you've got to get over it now"", whereas I'm more emotional. That's why we work because I'm a bit of a flapper in those situations and he's very on the ball and just gets on with it.' Ward spoke of how the pair were on holiday when Mahrez received the offer before he jetted home to say his goodbyes to his Manchester City team-mates - and the wheels started turning quickly. The fast-nature of the move left her with little time to process things, or even say her own goodbyes to people at the Etihad. 'We were actually on holiday at the time and there was talk about the move,' said Ward. 'Riyad had a few years left on his contract at City and was really settled there. Every conversation was ""we're not going to move yet, it's something we'll consider in a few years"". I started hearing people from Saudi showing interest but never thought anything would come of it. 'He flew home two days early to start pre-season so as far as I was concerned he was going back to Man City and that was it. One day he rang me while I was sat on the beach and said ""we're moving and I'm going tomorrow, that's it"". 'He put me on the phone to one of the girls at the club and I burst into tears - I was like ""I can't believe this is happening"". It happened so quick, you don't get a minute to say bye to everyone. One minute he was starting pre-season, the next he was saying goodbye.'   Married to the Game will show how the Mahrez family - including their 18-month-old daughter Mila - have settled into Jeddah, though Ward revealed she has so far been travelling back and forth from Manchester as she wraps up preparations to permanently move into their home. Much has been made of restrictions in Saudi Arabia. The family of former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson lived in the more commercial Bahrain during his ill-fated six-month spell, though they still struggled to settle before he sealed a move to Ajax in the Netherlands. Mail Sport reported how the wife one one player who had joined a Saudi club last summer was being hissed at in a shopping centre for wearing shorts. Meanwhile, searing temperatures of 30 degrees and paltry crowds at stadiums have also lessened the appetite for stars joining the Saudi revolution in a country that is set to host the 2030 World Cup. However, Ward insists she has been 'surprised' by life in the Middle East, having been made to feel a little bit closer to home after finding solace in a few creature comforts - including spotting an unlikely Nando's chain. 'So far, the experience has been amazing,' she added. 'There's obviously no alcohol so I won't be having a glass of wine! To be honest, there's more there than I originally thought. When I went on my first trip, I saw a Nando's. I was just like ""I'm so happy they've got Nando's"". 'The vibe is just very different. It's a lot more chilled out there, it's quieter and calmer, whereas in Manchester life is so busy - there's so much going on and we're always going out for dinner and seeing friends. That's probably what I'm missing the most, seeing family and friends rather than what the country is missing. 'The people have been so lovely - I think that was actually a massive shock, how nice everyone has been. You can't compare it to the UK - it's nothing like here. I'm enjoying it so far, it just feels like I'm on holiday, I don't feel like I've moved there yet.'  The restriction that cannot be escaped is the obvious segregations on gender, such as those seen in swimming pools and hotels, some of which only allow couples to stay together if they are married. But Ward claimed rules are being relaxed all the time, adding: 'I think it depends on where you go. At the moment they're looking at relaxing these rules. From what I had heard, I was worried about that stuff when we first went, but it's surprised me. It's more relaxed from what I was first told.' When put to her about Henderson's family living in the neighbouring Bahrain, she reiterated that she was happy in Jeddah and planned to be there for the foreseeable future. 'I'm not just saying this, I actually really like it,' she said. 'I can't fault it so far, we've really enjoyed it. We've just got our house here so I'll definitely be staying in Jeddah and won't be going anywhere else. 'It's got beautiful beaches, shops, restaurants. I don't think there would be any need to move anywhere else. I'll be in Jeddah for the forseeable that's for sure.' The series will explore other couples and their journeys to other destinations to follow the dreams of football stars, such as Sarah Gundogan travelling with husband Ilkay - a former City team-mate of Mahrez - this time going from Manchester to the more liberal Barcelona. So, would Ward fancy going to any other destination of her choice if the power were in her hands? She has maintained that wherever Mahrez goes, she goes - a vow that was made very early on in their relationship once things became serious, respecting that the player himself has a short career and needs to make the most of it. 'We always agreed from the beginning that with football things change and wherever he went I'd go with him,' she said.  'I'm very fortunate that with my job I can easily travel and I don't have anything holding me back in that sense. It was always something that I agreed to and said ""listen, I want us to stick together as a family"". Football careers are so short and you have to make the most of it. 'It was still a massive shock and when that day comes you can't prepare for it. Riyad will always do what's best for the family. If it was somewhere really shocking, he wouldn't agree to go in the first place. I trust him.' As for her friends and family - that has been one of the biggest wrenches of this move for Ward. She said they were 'devastated' and that not having them around was the toughest part, although a sweetener in the move is having her parents living in Dubai, just a two-hour flight away. 'Everyone's been really supportive,' Ward said. 'Obviously it was a shock at the beginning. My grandparents still live in the UK and they were devastated that I was leaving. It's only a five-and-a-half hour flight if they want to see me. We'll just do trips there and back and family will come see me. 'My mum and dad live in Dubai which is a two-hour flight away. They have been to Saudi six or seven times already - constantly turning up to come and see me which is nice.' There have already been murmurs of discontent from a handful of star names who have recently moved to the Saudi Pro League. In addition to Henderson being unsettled, former Liverpool man Roberto Firmino was reportedly eyeing a return to the Premier League, while ex-Real Madrid foward Karim Benzema fell out with his manager at Al-Ittihad, with rumours he was seeking an exit. But the same cannot be said for Mahrez, who Ward says is loving life at Al-Ahli and has no plans to return to the Premier League or move anywhere else for the meantime. 'Football is so unpredictable, when that transfer window opens you have no idea what's going to happen,' she went on. 'For now, the plan is to stay in Saudi for a few years and enjoy it. I put so much effort into making this house nice so I want to live in it for a bit and enjoy settling down.  'We'll see, who knows - right now he's really enjoying it. He loves his club and he's met some nice friends, a few other French guys on the team who he gets on really well with.' Ward has done a bit of that settling in herself by meeting up with fellow wives and girlfriends of Mahrez's team-mates at Al-Ahli, many of whom are 'in the same boat' exploring and discovering a new country in unfamiliar surroundings. She is hoping now that fans and viewers will see a different side to her and not just the 'glamorous side' that everyone sees on social media, insisting her life is 'not all roses and rainbows'. 'A lot of people see pictures on Instagram of our lives and think everything is so perfect and glamorous, but they don't see what we're like as people and what goes on behind the scenes,' Ward said. 'I hope it gives people a better insight into that and lets people get to know us better in that sense, and see that it's not all roses and rainbows. 'We're not these perfect people that lead these amazing, glamorous lives - we're actually very normal as well. I hope they get to see a bit of both.'","'We're not these perfect people that lead these amazing, glamorous lives - we're actually very normal as well. I hope they get to see a bit of both.'"
137,South Korea BRAWL left Son's finger dislocated as a PSG star tried to PUNCH him,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/South-Korea-BRAWL-left-Sons-finger-dislocated-as-a-PSG-star-tried-to-PUNCH-him/3301671,2 days ago,"The chaotic circumstances surrounding how Son Heung-min dislocated his finger on the eve of South Korea's humiliating Asian Cup exit have been revealed.  A bust-up erupted between Son and team-mates while they were eating on the eve of their semi-final clash with Jordan, which they lost 2-0 on February 6. Reports claimed that a number of young players in the squad had rushed eating their meal so they could dash off and play table tennis which infuriated Son, with the situation further escalating from there. However, more details have since emerged on what exactly transpired that night which saw the South Korea and Spurs captain walk away with a nasty finger injury. South Korea's Yonhap news agency first reported that Son initially tried to talk to the younger players â including PSG starlet Lee Kang-in â about bonding with their team-mates instead of rushing off to play table tennis.   The incident then turned physical when they refused to listen to their skipper, which saw a furious Son grab Lee. In a moment of madness, the PSG forward tried to punch Son in retaliation before the two players had to be pulled apart. During the fracas, Son dislocated his finger on his right hand and was seen sporting a bandage the next day for the match. The Korea Football Association (KFA) confirmed on Wednesday that the reports around the incident were true. 'It happened when some young players went up to play table tennis, and Son Heung-min and other older players took issue with it,' an official said, as quoted by Yonhap. 'The players exchanged a few words and Son hurt his finger in the process,' the official added. PSG's Lee has since apologised for his actions in a statement made on Wednesday morning.  The statement read: 'Good afternoon. This is Lee Kang-In. There is an article that he had a dispute with Son Heung Min before the 4th quarter of the Asian Cup. 'We are very disappointed in football fans who always support our national team. I am so sorry. I should have been in the forefront and obeyed my brothers, but I'm only sorry that I'm showing a bad side to football fans. 'I apologise to many of you who have disappointed me. I am well aware of the interest and expectations football fans send me. From now on, I will try to help my older brothers to become a better player and a better person.' Son still played in the 2-0 defeat by Jordan on the next day, wearing a bandage on the middle finger on his right hand. He continued to wear the strapping across his index and middle finger as he helped Spurs secure a late 2-1 win over Brighton last Saturday.  South Korea's exit against them was a huge shock, especially considering that Jordan had never even been past the semi-finals before. South Korean football fans have been livid with their side's shock exit from the competitions â in which they were seen as favourites to win. An inquest into Jurgen Klinsmann's reign as manager is now underway, with the Germany and Tottenham legend facing the sack for his side's shock exit.","An inquest into Jurgen Klinsmann's reign as manager is now underway, with the Germany and Tottenham legend facing the sack for his side's shock exit."
138,Brazil defeat for Real Madridâs Endrick clears up his Olympic Games dilemma,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Brazil-defeat-for-Real-Madrid%E2%80%99s-Endrick-clears-up-his-Olympic-Games-dilemma/3301587,2 days ago,"The Brazilianâs summer plans had long since been questioned with the forward having the chance to win Olympic Gold with his country.  Real Madrid had one eye on the South American ClÃ¡sico, a Brazil-Argentina match in which a place in the next Olympic Games in Paris was on the line. In the end, it was Mascheranoâs Argentina that booked their place at the Games and Brazil, champions of the Olympics in the last two editions, will miss out. On the Madrid side of the divide, however, the loss for the Gold Medal holders is seen as one less problem. Endrick will no longer have to make the difficult decision of choosing to attend the Olympics or participate in Madridâs pre-season campaign. In any case, as AS understood, the 17-year-oldâs entourage had already thought of putting the ball in Madridâs court, who wanted to keep him. Even if Brazil had qualified, it would have been very strange to see Endrick in Paris. But with the defeat, the question is answered. Endrick comes out strong from the U-23 Pre-Olympic tournament that has been played in Venezuela, despite the fact that the tournament wasnât his best in terms of sporting performance. He got two goals and an assist in the first three games, and only one black mark with his performance against Venezuela. In the last match against Argentina he found life very difficult, playing as a lone forward up top with Brazil ready to defend the draw that took them to Paris. The Argentine tactics were to simply kick him out of the game. But Endrickâs performance has gone further than just soccer. Signing for Real Madrid, which he will do when he comes of age next July, has catapulted Endrick to stardom. His presence with the U-23 team in the Pre-Olympic tournament has been quite the talking point in both Brazil and Venezuela. The playerâs father also travelled there, followed by the local media. He was relaxed, without feeling any pressure, speaking Spanish quite fluently and even organising a charity event in which he gifted Brazil, Palmeiras and even some Real Madrid shirts to help those in need. The feelings from within the Brazilian Federation are that Endrick has a good chance of going to the Copa AmÃ©rica with the senior national team. After all, he broke records when he made his debut at only 17 against Colombia and Argentina in the last FIFA window. The Copa AmÃ©rica will be played from June 20 to July 14; the problem for Madrid was due to come shortly after, at the Olympic Games. The Paris event, for football, starts on July 24 and ends on August 9 coinciding with the entire Los Blancos pre-season and almost steps on the toes of the start of the league, which is expected around August 17. Endrick turns 18 on July 21 and as of then his signing for the club will become official. The young Brazilian is very excited about his next stage and will prioritise pre-season with the rest of his new teammates, with the hope of make an impact from the beginning. Now, after a short break, he will rejoin Palmeiras, where he is an idol after having made history by winning two consecutive BrasileirÃ£o titles under the age of 18.","Endrick turns 18 on July 21 and as of then his signing for the club will become official.

140,Time to move on for De Jong?,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Time-to-move-on-for-De-Jong/3301779,2 days ago,"The Dutchman is on his way to letting another season pass without being BarÃ§aâs central character. Compared to GÃ¼ndoganâs ten assists, Frenkie has not given a single one. Transfer rumors have started up again.  Frenkie de Jongâs recent underwhelming performances have once again given ammunition to his circle of critics - those who consider that, despite his 80 million euro market value, he is not an elite player. The Dutchmanâs fifth season in Barcelona is passing him by. The issue goes beyond the numbers, which are already worrying in themselves. De Jongâs last goal for the team was back in August and has not given a single assist compared to GÃ¼ndoganâs 10. But the worst may not be in the statistics, but in the sensations. De Jong has become an insubstantial player. This season he has been unable to set the pace of BarÃ§aâs games. He doesnât take enough risks and he doesnât push the team. He has turned his games into bureaucratic exercises - which is probably the worst that can be said of a player, close to turning 27, and supposedly one of the teamâs spiritual leaders. Disappointment has also begun to permeate the fans - those who initially viewed his signing in 2019, one of the few good moves by Josep Maria Bartomeu. De Jong, who had impressed that season at Ajax, was wanted by PSG, Bayern, Liverpool and Manchester City. But he felt drawn to BarÃ§a - excited by that imaginary line that connects Barcelona with the Netherlands since the glory days of Johan Cruyff. In his favour, De Jong has been a very loyal player to BarÃ§a and seemed convinced that he could succeed there even when the odds were stacked against him and the team. When Joan Laporta tried to sell him in the summer of 2022, he kept silent and resisted the pressures he was subjected to. He was happy in the city and above all, he wanted to succeed at BarÃ§a. He has had some specific moments of splendor, especially during the 2020-21 season with Koeman at the helm. Together with Busquets and Pedri he formed part a midfield that fed Messi, won the Copa del Rey and fought for LaLiga  while play attractive football. With Xavi he is also remembered for a handful of good games. The emphatic 0-4 victory at the BernabÃ©u, the 2-4 triumph in Naples... But, five years after his signing, it can already be said that much more was expected of him. De Jong has never been dropped and, for several seasons, he has played without being at his best. This year he also suffered an injury to his right ankle (a distal tibioperoneal syndesmosis was formal diagnosis) in the Week 6 game against Celta. That forced him to sit out 10 games (seven in LaLiga, three in the Champions League) but since his return, he seems to be playing with a certain nonchalance. As if, for the first time, he could be considering the idea that his time BarÃ§a has come full circle. Last week, Esport 3 reported that the player may even be thinking about leaving if an offer from elsewhere arrives. BarÃ§a would certainly have no problems letting him go. Along with Lewandowski, he is the squadâs top earner, receiving around 20 million euros net this season. His departure would be a respite for Financial Fairplay and despite the fact that he is valued within the club, the general consensus would be to let him go because it is a question of survival and, unlike other cases, De Jong has been granted enough time to succeed.","Last week, Esport 3 reported that the player may even be thinking about leaving if an offer from elsewhere arrives.

143,Hojlund and Douglas Luiz CLASH during Manchester United's win over Aston Villa,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hojlund-and-Douglas-Luiz-CLASH-during-Manchester-Uniteds-win-over-Aston-Villa/3300342,12 Feb,"Douglas Luiz squared up to Rasmus Hojlund in the closing stages of Manchester United's win over Aston Villa on Sunday.  With both teams chasing a Champions League place, the pressure was on at Villa Park from the outset, with United in particular in danger of falling out of the race with a defeat. The visitors responded emphatically, with Hojlund continuing his hot streak in front of goal to give United the lead after connecting with a Harry Maguire header. With Luke Shaw replaced through injury at half-time United appeared significantly more vulnerable and Villa eventually forced their way back into the game with Luiz levelling after the hour mark. As the game approached its closing stages it appeared both sides would be content leaving with a point.   Scott McTominay's introduction increased the momentum late on, and the Scotsman was again on hand to produce a vital goal as he restored United's lead on 86 minutes. With Erik ten Hag looking to secure victory, Hojlund was replaced in stoppage time by Jonny Evans. The 21-year-old took his time departing the pitch as the clock ran down and offered a cheeky gesture to the Villa Park faithful by reminding them of the score as he left the pitch. Clearly unhappy with the gesture Luiz ran over to him and grabbed his shirt before ushering the forward off the pitch. Hojlund's actions clearly proved unpopular, with what appeared to be a member of the Villa staff caught on camera furiously shouting towards him as he made his way to the bench. United would have the last laugh though, as they held out to close the deficit between the two clubs to just five points.","United would have the last laugh though, as they held out to close the deficit between the two clubs to just five points."
144,Sebastien Haller: A cancer survivor on the cusp of AFCON glory with Ivory Coast,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Sebastien-Haller-A-cancer-survivor-on-the-cusp-of-AFCON-glory-with-Ivory-Coast/3299758,12 Feb,"July 18, 2022 is a date Sebastien Haller will never forget.  It was supposed to be a normal training day as Borussia Dortmund began their pre-season tour of Switzerland, with Haller joining the squad less than two weeks after arriving from Ajax for Â£31million. But it proved to be anything but, as the Ivorian striker reported feeling unwell in the morning, and after further examinations he was diagnosed with a testicular tumour, that was later confirmed to be cancer, just hours later. Fast forward 18 months, and he is about to play in the Africa Cup of Nations final for Ivory Coast against Nigeria. Yet representing his country on the biggest stage was unthinkable in the hours after his devastating diagnosis.  Well-wishes poured in for the popular forward, with Ajax's players holding up their former team-mate's shirt number before beating Red Bull Salzburg in a friendly the following day. Haller wasn't kidding himself, though, and knew he had a huge battle on his hands. Still, he was determined to stay positive, and later that week he was pictured in hospital giving a thumbs-up after beginning treatment. 'I wanted to let you know that Step 1 has been completed!' he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. It was clear that Haller had every intention of fighting his way through right from the start. Just over a month later, Haller appeared at an awards ceremony after finishing the previous season as the Eredivisie's top scorer at Ajax. In his acceptance speech, Haller thanked his friends and family for their unwavering support after starting chemotherapy, as he admitted 'I'm lucky to have people around me'. He wiped away tears on an emotional evening, as he delivered a powerful message of defiance.    After undergoing two operations, speculation ramped up towards the end of 2022 linking Haller with a return to football. Surely not? Just six months after being diagnosed with cancer, is that even possible? Haller proved it was. He was back on the training pitch in the opening days of January 2023, and immediately targeted getting himself into shape to hit the ground running once the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break later that month. After finding the net in some warm-up friendlies to show he hadn't lost his goalscoring touch, and wearing boots with message 'f*** cancer' on them as a reminder of what he'd battled through, Haller was thrown straight back into the team by manager Edin Terzic. He got his first competitive goal after treatment against Freiburg on February 4, which happened to be World Cancer Day. The stars had aligned for Haller, and he was adamant he wouldn't be stopped. Haller's triumphant comeback on the pitch was only a small part of his story, though, as he admitted he was 'proud' of his return, while Rio Ferdinand labelled him a 'trailblazer' for raising awareness of the need for men to get themselves checked following his shock diagnosis. Haller would have been forgiven for taking his time to get back up to speed after half a year away, but his team were in the midst of a title race with Bayern Munich and needed their striker to keep them in touch. The former West Ham man did exactly that, producing the goods time and time again as he scored nine goals in 19 league games.    This included five in three matches prior to the last game of the season, but Dortmund could only draw 2-2 with Mainz on the final day, as they agonisingly missed out on the title on goal difference to Bayern. Haller would later claim that missing out on the title was worse than hearing he had cancer. 'It really is true. The missed title hurts me more than the cancer diagnosis at the time,' the 29-year-old said. 'If you are sick, there is nothing you can do about it. You have to accept it and move through it. But we had the title in our own hands, we could influence everything ourselves. 'In that case you have to painfully accept that you may have made mistakes or wrong decisions.' It was a big statement to make, but one that highlighted his hunger for silverware, and AFCON was his next chance to take home a trophy. But not much has gone smoothly for Haller over the last 18 months, and he did not play a single minute in the group stages due to an ankle injury. His tournament could have been over before it even began as Ivory Coast lost two of their three matches, but somehow squeaked through to the knockout stages thanks to being one of the best third-placed teams.  Having sacked their manager Jean-Louis Gasset, Ivory Coast entered their last-16 clash against defending champions Senegal as underdogs, but upset the odds to triumph on penalties. Haller came off the bench in the second half and converted his spot-kick to spark jubilant scenes in the crowd as the home nation progressed to the quarter-finals. Mali lay in wait next, and Ivory Coast made things difficult for themselves once again. Their goalkeeper Yahia Fofana had to make a first-half penalty save to keep his side level, and then defender Odilon Kossounou was sent off shortly before the break. When Dorgeles Nene put Mali ahead with 20 minutes to go, Ivory Coast looked to be heading out, but Brighton's Simon Adingra forced extra time with a last-gasp equaliser. Still a man down, Ivory Coast held firm during the extra period with Haller doing his best to hold the ball up to relieve the pressure, and they got their reward when Oumar Diakite flicked home a dramatic winner in the 122nd minute. Onto the semi-finals, and Haller was finally fit enough to start against DR Congo.   In a game full of tension and few clear-cut opportunities, Haller produced the one moment of quality needed by volleying home Max Gradel's cross to seal his side's spot in the final. There cannot have been a more popular goalscorer in the tournament given what Haller has been through. And now he has the chance to win a major trophy with his country. It would only be fitting for Haller to be the difference-maker in Sunday's showpiece event. Haller has been on an incredible journey back to the top over the past 18 months that will have inspired countless people from around the world, and it could be about to get even better.","Haller has been on an incredible journey back to the top over the past 18 months that will have inspired countless people from around the world, and it could be about to get even better."
145,Which Premier League wonderkid would be picked No 1 in an NFL-style draft?,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Which-Premier-League-wonderkid-would-be-picked-No-1-in-an-NFL-style-draft/3301648,2 days ago,"Thierry Henry, Kate Abdo and Micah Richards have picked their best under-20 player in the Premier League, with the former Manchester City star making a surprise selection.  Fresh off the back of a thrilling Super Bowl that saw Kansas City Chiefs claim an overtime win against San Francisco 49ers, the trio were asked to name the rising star they would pick out from England's top flight if football adopted an NFL-style draft. The question created plenty of food for thought, with Richards initially keen to pick Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham before he was reminded that it had to be a Premier League player. Finally, he made his choice. 'I'm going to go with Mainoo, Man United. Start a team like that,' the CBS Sports pundit confirmed. Kobbie Mainoo has made a stunning start to his United career after breaking into the team shortly before Christmas. He scored a stunning solo goal in the 97th minute to secure a dramatic 4-3 win for the Red Devils against Wolves earlier this month, and has been compared to iconic central midfield duo Paul Scholes and Clarence Seedorf.  But it was still somewhat of a shock for Richards - who made almost 250 appearances for City - to go with a player from their biggest rivals. United fan Abdo also put club loyalties aside and selected a City star with a familiar name. 'Oh yeah, that's a nice shout, Micah from Man City! Micah Hamilton,' she said. Hamilton actually turned 20 in November, and has only made two senior appearances this season but has already made a positive impression. He got a goal and an assist on his Champions League debut in December as Pep Guardiola's men beat Red Star Belgrade 3-2 in Serbia.  Henry was pressed for his answer, as he gave his own unique take. 'I would trust my youth team,' he insisted. 'Sorry, that is an option also. Why are you upset? Why do you have an academy for?' which left Richards giggling. Henry is the only one of the panel with managerial experience, having previously taken charge of Monaco and Montreal Impact, while he also served as Roberto Martinez's assistant for Belgium. He is now the France Under-21 coach, and won his first four games at the helm, but lost two games in the space of three days against Austria and South Korea in November.","He is now the France Under-21 coach, and won his first four games at the helm, but lost two games in the space of three days against Austria and South Korea in November."

The 23-year-old is on a season-long loan from Bayern, who he joined as a youth player in 2017 and has become an integral part of Xabi Alonso's team of title chasers. Whereas in the Premier League players who are on loan are not permitted to play against their parent clubs, that rule doesn't apply in the Bundesliga and Stanisic started the weekend crunch clash. He opened the scoring in the 18th-minute with a  tap-in at the back-post and celebrated mutely with his two arm raised in the arm out of respect for Bayern Munich. Speaking after the match, he revealed that he was happy to score despite it being against his permanent club and stressed he wants to do his best for Bundesliga leaders Leverkusen.  'Even though you're happy, you also somewhat feel sorry. I didn't celebrate out of respect'. 'I wanted to prove it to myself first and foremost. I want to do my best for Bayer Leverkusen this season'. His comments come after Bayern manager Thomas Tuchel fumed that the attacking full-back was allowed to play in the match that could prove pivotal in the title race.  Bayern needed to win to jump ahead of Leverkusen at the top of the table but slumped to a demolishing defeat that puts serious doubt on their title ambitions. An aggravated Tuchel hit out at rules on loan players in Germany, stating: 'In England there's a nice rule where when you loan a player out, they can't play against you. 'For me that makes more sense. The rule unfortunately doesn't exist in Germany'. Stanisic, who was born in Munich, has made 20 appearances so far this season while on loan at Leverkusen.","Stanisic, who was born in Munich, has made 20 appearances so far this season while on loan at Leverkusen."

Bosnich, 52, won the Premier League title with Manchester United in 2000 and is regarded as a football cult hero due to his colourful life on and off the pitch during his heyday. After hanging up his gloves in 2009, the former Socceroo has become a staple figure on Australian television, providing his knowledge on all things football for many years. Stan Sport's Max Rushden and Craig Foster explained the scary situation before the kick-off of the Champions League round of 16 clash between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Sociedad on Thursday morning. 'We miss you buddy. I hope you're well and feeling OK,' Foster said.  'For those of you who don't know, he had chest pains, he's had a stent put in,' Rushden explained. The pair said Bosnich became distressed while exercising at work on Wednesday. 'He was making a lot of noise....and he said 'I'm going to get it checked out',' Rushden said. 'He did, he's OK, he's back tomorrow but we are sending you our love Boz, it is very quiet without you.' Foster said 'Bozza' immediately seeking help was the right thing to do. 'If you're not sure about anything, health wise, get checked,' Rushden added. 'Men are useless at talking about it and doing anything about it. 'The sooner you find anything is wrong, the better it is. That is our message and that is Mark's message too.'  Bosnich posted a thumbs-up photo of himself to social media from hospital after undergoing a successful operation to have a stent put in. Bosnich's update triggered an outpouring of get well soon messages, including from former boxing champion George Kambosos Jr. 'Speedy recovery Bozza,' he replied. Bosnich posted another hospital update on Thursday morning thanking fans for all the 'wonderful messages' and announcing that he will be back to work on Friday. Bosnich, who famously dated model Sophie Anderton during his playing days in England, married his long-term partner Sara Jones in a lavish wedding ceremony last year. The Australian's former United teammate Dwight Yorke was by his side as best man. Bosnich and Jones, 35, have been together for 12 years, and faced a long wait for their happy day, having got engaged in 2018. The pair have two children together, 10-year-old Allegra and five-year-old Cassius; who both took part in the bridal party.","The pair have two children together, 10-year-old Allegra and five-year-old Cassius; who both took part in the bridal party."

The experienced defender signed a one year renewal in Catalonia in 2023 and his current deal expires at the end of the 2023/24 campaign. Barcelona and Roberto are confident they can reach an agreement which would activate a 12 month extension to 2025. However, the club are not viewing his situation as a priority, with his name also on a list that could be offloaded, if their financial issues continue.  Roberto is currently sidelined through injury, but his versatility and willingness to play a squad role, has proven valuable for Xavi this season. Xavi was asked about his view on what the club should do regarding Robertoâs future, and the former Spanish international is clear on his preference for a renewal, despite his own exit. âI donât know if it will be his last season.

The playmaker has become a regular starter in recent months despite competing for places with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva. Foden underlined his importance after scoring in City's Champions League last-16 victory in Copenhagen, a result that saw them place one foot in the quarter-finals. With the holders leading by a single goal heading into injury time, Foden netted with one of the final kicks of the game to place them in control ahead of the return leg. And, speaking post-match, he reflected on his newfound prominent role.  Quizzed on whether he had ever felt more vital, Foden told TNT Sports: 'I don't think so. It's the most run of games I've probably had in a City shirt. 'When you're playing every game I think you can get a lot of rhythm. I'm feeling good this year and I'm helping the team the best I can.' Foden believes the key to his impressive performances lies in his consistent run of starts rather than Guardiola's tactical decision to field him in central positions. 'Like I said, when you get a run of games you find your feet and start getting connections with other players,' he added. 'I first started playing in the pocket but today I played wide and did an alright job.'   Foden has typically played on the flanks or the No 10 position since making his breakthrough at City but feels more comfortable dictating play as the fulcrum. 'I just feel alive,' Foden explained. 'I feel like I'm always involved in the game. 'You can get into the game as well, I feel. You can get the ball, play a decent few passes and build your confidence. Out wide you have to wait for the ball.' City have been tipped to lift the Champions League for a second straight year and have all but reached the last-eight ahead of their home leg against Copenhagen.

The 21-year-old Athletic Club forward has been in sensational form over the last 12 months, which has seen him become a regular for the Spanish national team under head coach Luis de la Fuente.  The likelihood is that Williams will be heading to Germany with La Roja for Euro 2024, and that could be the start of a big summer for him. Not only could he be competing at the major tournament, he could also be on the move, with clubs queueing up to sign him from Athletic. A number of Premier League clubs have been linked with Williams of late, and given that his release clause is just â¬50m, the likelihood is that this will be triggered in the summer. Arsenal appear to be best placed to sign him, as El Chiringuito have reported that they have recently stepped up their interest. Losing Williams would be a big blow for Athletic Club, although the money generated would significantly help Ernesto Valverde bolster his squad.","Losing Williams would be a big blow for Athletic Club, although the money generated would significantly help Ernesto Valverde bolster his squad."
157,Arsenal fans joke only trophy ex-Spurs Kane looks likely to win is cannon badge,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-fans-joke-only-trophy-ex-Spurs-Kane-looks-likely-to-win-is-cannon-badge/3302055,1 day ago,"Harry Kane might miss out on any club silverware in his first season at Bayern Munich - but a potential personal accolade has brought laughter to Arsenal fans.  Bayern trail Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga table by five points, after a 3-0 defeat to their title rivals on Saturday evening - and while there are 13 games of the season remaining, it would be the first time in 12 years that Bayern have failed to win the German league if they cannot claw back the deficit. And the pressure is mounting on the German giants after their 1-0 defeat to Lazio on Wednesday night meant they are up against it in the last 16 of the Champions League. However, fans noted that former Tottenham talisman Kane is on course to bag the Torjagerkanone Award, the German equivalent of the Golden Boot, for his 24 goals in 21 league appearances for Bayern, seven goals clear of his nearest rival. There's just one thing: the trophy looks like a cannon, one of the famous emblems of Arsenal, the local rivals of Spurs.  One fan wrote on X (formerly Twitter): 'So, Harry Kane could finish this season as the Bundesligaâs top scorer, but still without a championship trophy to his nameâ¦ 'And the funniest part - Have you seen what the award for being top scorer in Germany actually looks like?' They shared pictures of other former winners of the trophy, including ex-Bayern star Robert Lewandowski, who won the prize seven times. Fans responded to the tweet mocking Kane's potential prize, with various responses including 'No way !!!! This would just be hilarious', 'HAHAHAHA this is awesome' and 'This is truly wonderful..'. To further compound matters - and dragging the North London argument across to the German title race - former Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka has made 21 league appearances for Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen side this season. Another wrote: 'Would be the Spursiest thing ever. Joining a team that's won the league 11 seasons in a row and finishing top-scorer after a record-breaking season of goal scoring, only to finish second to a team with an ex-Arsenal player and getting a cannon-shaped trophy for his exploits.'        Meanwhile, someone else noted: 'the Bundesliga has the chance to do the funniest thing ever'. The England captain said himself that his Â£100m move to the Bundesliga giants was inspired by silverware, having yet to win a trophy during his career, but with Bayern up against it in the league and Europe - and out of the German Cup - he might be waiting a little longer. Last year's Torjagerkanone - which literally means ""goalscorer cannon"" - was split between Niclas Fullkrug and Christopher Nkunku, who both scored 16 goals each.","Last year's Torjagerkanone - which literally means ""goalscorer cannon"" - was split between Niclas Fullkrug and Christopher Nkunku, who both scored 16 goals each."

As reported by The Independent, Mbappe would be open to signing for Arsenal but the Gunners aren't prepared to break their financial strategy in order to facilitate a deal. The same situation applies to Liverpool, who didn't make an offer for the France star when Mbappe's wider circle reached out to them last year. There is much uncertainty regarding the future of Mbappe, whose PSG contract is set to expire at the end of June. Mbappe has been heavily linked with a switch to Real Madrid but a move has yet to be finalised.  Mbappe would be willing to join Arsenal as it would mean following in the footsteps of legendary fellow Frenchman Thierry Henry. Henry scored a club record 228 goals for the Gunners and was a key part of the club's famous Invincibles side that won the Premier League title in 2003-04 without losing a single game. Mbappe has often been compared to Henry throughout is career, with both players having made their senior breakthrough at Monaco. During his time at PSG, Mbappe has scored a hugely impressive 242 goals in 289 appearances. Mbappe's entourage reportedly have doubts regarding Real Madrid's contract offer. Real proposal for Mbappe is believed to be less than what the offered when they previously attempted to sign him in 2022. ",

Guimaraes is in fine form and registered a superb brace during the Magpies 3-2 win of Nottingham Forest on Saturday. The Brazilian midfielder has been involved in five goals, scoring two and assisting three others, in his last five games. Since signing for Eddie Howe's side Guimaraes has been a central part of their team, and has developed an incredible relationship with the fans. He paid tribute to this connection with the Newcastle faithful, and also claimed he is 'very happy' on Tyneside.   Speaking to Sky Sports after the game Guimaraes said: 'Sometimes the people speak a lot about me, I just think about football. 'I'm happy here, in this club doing my best. I love the way the fans like me so I focus on my football and let the people speak. 'Sometimes (people speak about me leaving Newcastle). I'm very happy here, enjoy it a lot. I never felt so much love for the fans like here. 'They've been unbelievable for me and my family so I try to play for fans. So I hope I can keep going here for as long as possible.' Accordfing to reports Newcastle would consider selling Bruno Guimaraes in the summer if Barcelona or Real Madrid make an offer. However should Premier Legague rivals such as Liverpool or Chelsea come in they are expected to pay his full Â£100m release clause.  Newcastle's current financial situation could force them to cash in on Guimaraes when they can, after it was reported the Magpies recorded losses of Â£73.4m earlier this week when announcing their latest financial results. Should they qualify for Europe again this season, Newcasle's financial situation would be greatly improved. Guimaraes said: 'We have to get Europe again, at least Europa League. We have all the possibilities to get there, we have been playing better away than home. It was the opposite last season so it's good to get another three points away.'","Guimaraes said: 'We have to get Europe again, at least Europa League.

160,Erik ten Hag steps up six-player Man Utd transfer plan but Tottenham pose problem,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Erik-ten-Hag-steps-up-six-player-Man-Utd-transfer-plan-but-Tottenham-pose-problem/3301536,2 days ago,"Manchester United are set to face competition from Tottenham in the race to sign highly-rated Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite.  Branthwaite, 21, is being eyed by United chiefs to spearhead a youthful recruitment drive led by incoming part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. INEOS chairman Ratcliffe, who's on the verge of becoming a 25 per cent stakeholder in United, received official ratification from the Premier League on Tuesday and it's expected that he'll be given the green light by the FA either this week or not. Ratcliffe's Â£1.3billion agreement with the Glazers also hands him control of the Red Devils' football operations and the opportunity to instill his focus of signing homegrown players. Branthwaite is in the midst of a true breakthrough season at Goodison Park, having enjoyed a loan spell with PSV Eindhoven last term working under ex-United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. But it's not just the Red Devils who are interested in signing the England hopeful, as the Daily Mail claim that Tottenham have stepped up their efforts to sign him. Arsenal, Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid have also made enquiries, so United supporters will be pleased to know that Branthwaite is just one name on Ratcliffe's six-man shortlist. Three more up-and-coming young centre-backs have been mentioned during internal discussions such as Jean-Clair Todibo, who plays for INEOS-owned Nice. The 24-year-old Frenchman is part of the best defence in Ligue 1 this season, but it's not just Todibo who's impressing in France's first tier. 18-year-old Lille starlet Leny Yoro is another defensive option for the Red Devils, although they'll likely face competition from Paris Saint-Germain. Benfica's Antonio Silva, 20, is also someone who United are believed to be keeping tabs on. There's also a focus on signing a Premier League-proven attacker, with Wolves winger Pedro Neto on the list of potential targets alongside Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. It appears that Olise is a more concrete option for Ratcliffe and co, with a release clause - worth in the region of Â£60million - set to become active this summer. To do any major deals, however, the Red Devils will need to free-up cash and keep themselves away from any trouble relating to Financial Fair play. Two big names who could be off United's wage book by July are Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial, both of whom are out of contract at the end of this season. Manager Erik ten Hag insists that decisions haven't yet been made but, especially in Martial's case, it's looking increasingly unlikely that the Red Devils will extend either of the duo's stays.

We are not the last arrived, if you show too much respect you are afraid and if you are afraid then you lose. ""There will be moments in which we will suffer tomorrow because they are strong. Knowing that, what will happen and it's for mature people, accepting it means losing. We have to convince ourselves that we can win because it's true. ""In an entire championship they are stronger but in a single match they can be beaten."" On former Inter striker Romelu Lukaku, De Rossi also said: ""I try to separate the emotional aspect from the football one. I have to speak to the hearts of the players, for me it would be enough for him to play the same match as against Cagliari. I liked Monday a lot. He'll be able to manage a bit of emotion, he's no longer 20 years old.""","On former Inter striker Romelu Lukaku, De Rossi also said: ""I try to separate the emotional aspect from the football one.

The likes of Ronald Araujo, Frenkie de Jong and Raphinha have all been rumoured as possible departures, but one that the club do not intend to sell is Gavi â the 19-year-old midfielder is considered to be an âuntouchableâ.  However, this is unlikely to stop Paris Saint-Germain from making a move. Fresh from losing Kylian Mbappe, whose impending departure will save them a significant amount of money in terms of wages, the French champions have added Gavi to their summer shortlist, as reported by The Athletic. PSG head coach Luis Enrique, formerly of Barcelona, is a huge admirer of Gavi, having managed him during his time in charge of Spain. He dreams of being re-united with the teenager in the French capital. It would be the second time in two summers that PSG tried for a Barcelona player, following their move for Ousmane Dembele in 2023. Although that deal looked somewhat improbable at the time, this one is even more so, as Gavi has a â¬1bn, which the Catalans will refer any interested club to.","It would be the second time in two summers that PSG tried for a Barcelona player, following their move for Ousmane Dembele in 2023.

The former Premier League pair turned pundits were covering the game in Malaysia, with Agbonlahor tweeting his support for his former club before the game. Agbonlahor even implored Unai Emery to tinker with his tactics on social media prior to the clash, insisting that playing a high defensive line would be 'suicidal' due to a lack of pace in defence. Despite his well wishes it was United who struck first on Sunday, with Harry Maguire's header finding Rasmus Hojlund who duly converted to notch his first Premier League goal of the season. Agbonlahor will have been buoyed by Villa's momentum for much of the first 45 minutes, and no doubt ecstatic to see Douglas Luiz fire home from close range to equalise after the hour mark.  Both teams appeared content to leave Villa Park with a point before Scott McTominay was once again on hand to find what would prove to be a winning goal for United. Capturing the reaction just as United's euphoric celebrations were underway, O'Hara laughed at his broadcast partner whilst Agbonlahor looked on despondently in a clip that the former Spurs midfielder later shared on social media. Following the game Agbonlahor tweeted that he had 'never seen a more one sided game' and that 'football is cruel'.  The defeat will likely have been doubly frustrating for Agbonlahor given his recent public spat with United legend Gary Neville. Last month the former Villa star called ex-United defender Nemanja Vidic the most 'over-rated' centre-back in the Premier League and claimed Neville was a 'poor player at a great club.' Neville later responded on Sky's Stick to Football podcast, claiming the three-cap England international had managed just one win 21 career appearances against United.","Neville later responded on Sky's Stick to Football podcast, claiming the three-cap England international had managed just one win 21 career appearances against United."

The OGC Nice defender, 24, has been a star performer for the Ligue 1 outfit owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and was heavily linked with both Chelsea and United in last month's January transfer window, although neither club made a move for the Frenchman. With Todibo in tow, Nice are currently second in the French league after shipping just 11 goals in Ligue 1 this term but continue to be plagued by speculation over the future of their influential centre-back. And while Todibo far from closed the door on the possibility of staying on at Nice, he appeared to indicate that he would take stock of all the options available to him at the end of the current campaign. When he was pressed about a potential move away from France, Todibo responded: ""I am at Nice and weâre having a great season. I donât have my head elsewhere. If I did it would be difficult for me personally and for the group too. ""I feel really good at Nice. Weâll see what happens in the summer but weâre not there yet. I donât want to get ahead of myself. I donât want to give false hope. For now, Iâm here at Nice."" The defender then assured fans that he would not make a decision on his long-term future until the end of the season, adding: ""Football moves quickly, you never know whatâs going to happen. Iâll wait until the summer to make my decision. If my decision is to stay, Iâll announce it, if it is to leave, Iâll announce it too and Iâll thank everyone, but weâre not there yet."" The France defender, who is also expected to attract interest from other European heavyweights when the transfer window reopens, also stressed that he ""wants to leave something good behind"" if he is to move on in the summer. ""There are important games coming up. The goal is that if it is to be my final season at Nice, then I want to leave here having done something beautiful with the club,â he went on.

Foden scored Man City's third and final goal to wrap up a confident first leg win in the Champions League last-16 to cap off a superb display, and was in a good mood as he spoke to the broadcaster after the game. The 23-year-old has become a key figure under Pep Guardiola this season, scoring 14 times and providing 10 assists at the Etihad to lead their hopes of another big trophy haul, while also giving himself a huge chance of making England's starting XI at Euro 2024 this summer. And after assessing his performance in Denmark, the topic quickly turned to Foden's hair after pundit Richards noticed he had a 'fresh trim' - asking the player how much he pays for a haircut. 'Before you go, whose your barber because your trim is looking quite fresh I'm not gonna lie,' Richards asked the player.   Foden then responded: 'I've heard you pay a lot for your trim,' leaving Richards and fellow pundits Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry in stitches. Richards revealed the eyewatering sum he spends on a haircut last year - claiming he spends around Â£600 a week on three separate trips to the barber. Presenter Kate Abdo then pressed Foden on how much he splashes out, with the England international answer shocking the studio. 'Â£20 from the local. I swear. I sort him out sometimes but I've been to the same barber since the age of eight.' During a Champions League night last year, Richards explained his baffling expenditure on a trim. 'What does my barber cost? Â£200 a time yes. When I say the most, like I'll get a trim tomorrow for the Champions League and I'm working the weekend so I'll get a trim.  'I did it today. I've got to get a sharpen up tomorrow.' Abdo then went on to explain that three haircuts a week at that price equates to over Â£31,000 a year though Richards insisted it was only during punditry weeks. Foden was speaking to the punditry team about his sparkling form that has seen him score five goals in the last three games. Quizzed on whether he had ever felt more vital, Foden told TNT Sports: 'I don't think so. It's the most run of games I've probably had in a City shirt. 'When you're playing every game I think you can get a lot of rhythm. I'm feeling good this year and I'm helping the team the best I can.'

Ciro Immobile's first-half strike condemned Bayern to their second crucial defeat in five days after last Saturday's 3-0 drubbing against Bayer Leverkusen in a top-of-the-table Bundesliga clash. Those results have increased the pressure on Tuchel, who is approaching one year at the helm in Bavaria. And former Chelsea boss Tuchel let loose at his Bayern players in the changing room after the defeat at the Stadio Olimpico as he criticised the quality of his squad. According to Sky Germany, Tuchel said: ""You're not as good as I thought, then I just have to adapt to your level."" Tuchel was asked about his future in his post-match press conference. Bayern are out of the DFB-Pokal, sit five points behind Leverkusen in the Bundesliga and are facing the prospect of exiting the Champions League. They also lost against RB Leizpig in the Super Cup final in August. ""No, I'm not worried about my future,"" Tuchel said. ""We did everything to lose this match. It was in our hands. At a certain point we stopped believing, I've no idea why. There were many individual mistakes."" Tuchel added: ""We're frustrated and angry about the defeat. I think we lost the game, I'm not sure Lazio won it. I'm not sure why we lost our conviction in the second half, but we did, and then we fell behind. ""I can't explain it because we told the team to maintain their intensity and be even braver going forward, but we seemed to lose face at the start of the half. ""There are things we can build on. In the first half, we created some good chances, some big chances and one huge one with Jamal [Musiala], but in the end we didn't have a single shot on target. ""It's clear you can't win a game like that. But we've got a second leg and, obviously in conjunction with the last result, it doesn't look great, but we'll keep working hard."" Harry Kane, who failed to muster a shot on target against Lazio on Wednesday, issued a demand to his Bayern players as they look for a quick response. ""It's been a really tough week,"" Kane told TNT Sports. ""In the first half we started well and had clear chances, one for myself. In these games they're big moments. The second half was disappointing. We came out with less energy and less confidence. We got punished. Once you go down to 10 men it's always difficult. ""We have to find it among ourselves. We're still in the race for the Bundesliga and in this tie. We have to keep fighting. We're in a difficult spell. We have to fight. ""We have to turn it round. We have big games and big things to fight for. We're not out of it, we will never give up. We just need to turn it around. One game or spark can turn it round."" Bayern are next in action when they travel to VFL Bochum on Sunday. This followed by a critical home game against RB Leipzig, before an away trip to SC Freiburg.","Bayern are next in action when they travel to VFL Bochum on Sunday.

168,Ronaldo showed scoring skills by netting first goal in Asian Champions League,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ronaldo-showed-scoring-skills-by-netting-first-goal-in-Asian-Champions-League/3302078,1 day ago,"Cristiano Ronaldo gets his first goal in the Asian Champions League  The Portuguese forward showed he still had a nose for goal with a strike in the Asian continental competition. Cristiano Ronaldo and his eye for goal are still as alive as ever. He confirmed this theory by scoring the only goal of the game - a delightful chip - in the first leg of the round of 16 match against Al Feiha in the Asian Champions League. On February 14, the top scorer in the history of soccer once again demonstrated his love for finding the back of the net. âCR7â² turned 39 years old on February 5 and today, on Valentineâs Day, he scored his first goal of the year, meaning he has registered at least one goal every year between 2002 and 2024. As well as this, he has now scored in two Champions League qualifiers in different continents (Europe and Asia). He finished 2023 as the top scorer of the year in all competitions, ahead of players such as Erling Haaland and Kylian MbappÃ©, now, he has 31 goals and 11 assists during the 32 games he has played with Al Nassr during the current season. Talking about Cristiano Ronaldo is synonymous with success and glory within football, as the Portuguese star never tires of breaking records game after game. âIâll say when Iâm done,â he declared on social media as he finished 2023 as the top scorer in the sport. As if that wasnât enough, in addition to scoring the only goal and the winner against Al Feiha, he played his 1,000th match at club level. Now, Luis Castroâs squad is aiming to build on todayâs achievement and advance in the Asian Champions League, while in the Saudi Arabian league they are looking to close the gap on Neymarâs Al-Hilal.","As if that wasnât enough, in addition to scoring the only goal and the winner against Al Feiha, he played his 1,000th match at club level.

169,Will fifth in EPL qualify for Champions League? How Liverpool could help Man Utd,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Will-fifth-in-EPL-qualify-for-Champions-League-How-Liverpool-could-help-Man-Utd/3300791,12 Feb,"The Champions League will be revamped for next season with 36 clubs taking part - four more than usual - and that could increase English participation.  Of the additional four, two of those places will go to the leagues who have performed the best across all three European competitions this season. It all comes down to coefficient points - effectively UEFA's way of determining which leagues are doing the best across all their tournaments. Points are handed out for wins and draws, effectively pitting the leagues against each other, and the picture will change again this week with the knockout stages in the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League all beginning. The more teams your country has doesn't necessarily increase your ranking though, as it is determined on averages. For example, the Czech Republic, whilst their clubs aren't perhaps considered the most competitive, have an average of 12 points and sit fifth in this season's coefficient - above the likes of France. The Czech clubs only have 48 points, but that is split between four teams. Ligue 1 clubs might have racked up 69.5 points, but that's split between six teams, giving them an average of 11.5 points. This year England began with eight teams in European football - four in the Champions League, three in the Europa League and one in the Europa Conference League. That is now down to six with Newcastle United and Manchester United getting dumped out of the top tier competition. However, as explained previously, English teams have actually amassed more points that their rivals from Italy and Germany. (England 109, Italy 98, Germany 95.5). However there were only seven teams from Italy and Germany competing, so once you do the average per team they sit higher than the English. England have six teams in the knockout round, Italy have six and Germany seven. Each nation will fancy themselves to rack up sufficient coefficient points to put them in the top two spots required to land an extra team in the Champions League One issue is that some teams - albeit not the English ones - will play the knockout playoff round in the Europa League and the Europa Conference League this week and next. It means points can be added to the national association score, but not every club gets that chance. So while you gain more bonus points for winning a group - something Liverpool, West Ham and Brighton did in the Europa League, and Aston Villa did in the Conference League - rather than finishing second, the runners-up are capable of adding greater points because they will feature in the knockout playoff round, whilst all group winners go straight into the last 16. To make it real, Europa League group winners get four bonus points, and the runners-up get two bonus points. But the runners-up play in the knockout playoff round with an additional four points available through the results of each leg, if they win both matches. English teams, especially in the Champions League, will be chuffed with their ties. Not least because they've avoided their rivals. Arsenal take on Porto with defending European champions City facing Danish side Copenhagen. Italy, Germany and Spain - who are the three main threats to the England teams - have found themselves facing each other, which could see them taking coefficient points off each other. Inter Milan take on Atletico Madrid, Napoli face Barcelona, RB Leipzig will be against Real Madrid and Lazio have been drawn against Bayern Munich. French teams could also make some major inroads over the next fortnight or so, largely because they have four of their six teams in the knockout playoff round. Lens, Marseille, Rennes and Toulouse are all in action with PSG and Lille already into the last 16 of their respective tournaments. The Premier League table currently looks to be three into one for the top four. City, Liverpool and Arsenal look to have separated themselves from the chasing pack. It leaves Tottenham, who sit in fourth, looking to hold off Manchester United and Aston Villa. But it is the fifth spot that could prove crucial. Champions League is crucial for United whilst it would be massive for Villa's development. Work still needs to be done by the English teams in Europe if they are to jump up a spot in the coefficient rankings. City will be fancied to go far and potentially defend their title. But it is in the other two tournaments that the Premier League sides could really make inroads. With the bookies City, Liverpool and Villa are the favourites to win their respective competitions, which would mean an English clean sweep. If that happens, a fifth team from England will almost certainly be in the Champions League.","City will be fancied to go far and potentially defend their title.

170,"Tottenham are the KINGS of the late, late show...",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tottenham-are-the-KINGS-of-the-late-late-show.../3300693,12 Feb,"James Maddison did not have the energy to sprint for the goal celebrations as Tottenham claimed another late victory but he could savour the feeling as he flopped on to the turf.  âWe seem to do that a lot, donât we? Iâm dying for a comfortable 3-0 win,â said Maddison after Spurs came from behind to clinch victory over Brighton, with a 96th-minute goal by Brennan Johnson. It was a third stoppage-time winner in 11 Premier League home games under Ange Postecoglou, all scored when kicking towards 17,500 fans in the huge South Stand. Earlier this season, they forced a 96th-minute own goal against nine-man Liverpool and scored twice in added time against Sheffield United to turn defeat into victory in the 100th minute. âThereâs a beauty to winning late,â said Maddison. âScoring goals at the death like that, and having to show real character and mentality to keep going at the end of games. Itâs a wonderful feeling.â  Postecoglou would agree. His team are not immune from conceding late goals, including an equaliser at Everton on their previous outing, but a commitment to keep pushing forward and a refusal to play safe even if it might mean getting caught out is central to his philosophy. To see tangible evidence that it can bring rewards is important, even if the Spurs boss was not entirely happy with the performance against Brighton. âThe clock and scoreboard shouldnât dictate how you play,â said Postecoglou. âYou should always be looking for goals irrespective of whether youâre winning 1-0 or losing 1-0. âSometimes that feels counter-intuitive when youâre winning 1-0 but it helps in games when youâre chasing the game. You donât have to change anything. Thereâs no instructions from me. The players know what we do. If youâre trying to become a dominant team that wins games of football, Iâd rather err on that side than trying to protect things you have.â It helps, of course, if you have quality options on the bench. Postecoglou demands his team play relentlessly at high intensity. Maddison played through to the final whistle for the first time since his return from injury and was on his last legs as he played his part in the build-up to Johnsonâs goal. Son Heung-min, who sprinted down the left and delivered a perfect cross, and Johnson who applied the finish at the back post, however, were relatively fresh. They came on in the 62nd minute, after Pape Matar Sarr had cancelled out Pascal Grossâs first-half penalty. When Spurs struck late against Sheffield United in September, Postecoglou had been able to send on fresh attacking quality in the shape of Johnson, Richarlison and Ivan Perisic.  Against Liverpool, it was probably more to do with the fatigue of the visitors, who had long been down to nine men when Joel Matip sliced into his own goal. In an era of five substitutions and 100-minute games, the bench is crucial. And injuries and international call-ups have denied Postecoglou the luxury in recent weeks. Others can say the same, including Brighton, who play according to the same principles as Tottenham. They have Kaoru Mitoma and Ansu Fati back but are without top scorer Joao Pedro. Roberto de Zerbi is expected back on the training ground today. De Zerbi missed Saturdayâs game as he served a touchline ban and watched from home in Italy after dental surgery.","Others can say the same, including Brighton, who play according to the same principles as Tottenham.

171,Mourinho predicts Premier League and Champions League winners this season,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mourinho-predicts-Premier-League-and-Champions-League-winners-this-season/3302658,18 hours ago,"Jose Mourinho has named the teams that he backs to win the Premier League and Champions League this season.  He also revealed which of his former sides he would 'love' to go on and claim honours this campaign. The Portuguese coach is out of work having been dismissed by Roma in January, once again succumbing to the third-season syndrome that has stalked his career. Appearing on Rio Ferdinand's FIVE YouTube channel, he regaled viewers with talk of his immediate future, his struggle to gut the Manchester United dressing room of rotten eggs, and his preferred midfielder from England's golden generation. On top of all that, he gave his definitive predictions on the Premier League and Champions League.   On the domestic front, he briefly mulled over Manchester City and Liverpool, before putting his eggs in Pep Guardiola's basket by favouring his side. 'Champions League, I would say City or Real Madrid,' the Football.com global ambassador said. 'If somebody outside [those two] wins it, for me, it would be a great surprise. 'I would love Real Madrid to win it again for the club and for Carlo [Ancelotti]. I don't know, Bayern Munich can do it, Paris Saint-Germain. 'Looking at potential, I think City/Liverpool for the Premier [League], City/Real for the Champions [League].' In fairness to Mourinho, it would have been hard to back former clubs such as Manchester United and Chelsea for the Champions League considering they aren't in it, and they don't have much hope in England's top flight either. His interview with Ferdinand and Stephen Howson was wide-ranging and at times emotional. He admitted that his exit from Roma, where he won the Europa Conference League and reached a Europa League final, was the one that 'hurt' him 'the most.' 'I gave everything, I gave my heart, I gave even some options that could be considered not very clever from the professional point of view,' he said. 'I refused some great working opportunities. The first one was very hard to refuse because it was Portugal national team, probably the best Portugal national team ever and three years before a World Cup.    'Then I had a big one from Saudi and I didn't hide it at the time because it was really big. 'I did it - normally I a very pragmatic in my choices, very professional in my choices and I try to be very emotionally controlled and you could see that when I left other clubs after winning finals. 'In this case I was not pragmatic, I was emotional and I gave everything. So in the end when I left, I left hurt. I had the great feeling that I gave so much happiness to the people. 'Two European finals in a row doesn't happen too often, especially in a club like Roma which doesn't have a big history of European success. 'Then I was walking in the street and the people were like ""take us to Dublin, take us to Dublin"" [for this year's Europa League final] and so I had that in my mind, the third European final in a row. 'But you have to respect, the owner is always the owner. It's not the first time I left a club, it is probably the first time I am feeling it in a different way. 'You move on, you try to learn from the experience be better for the next one.' All three parts of the interview are available on FIVE's YouTube - The full interview with JosÃ© Mourinho will be available on @FIVEUKâs audio platforms, Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts.","All three parts of the interview are available on FIVE's YouTube - The full interview with JosÃ© Mourinho will be available on @FIVEUKâs audio platforms, Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts."
172,Carragher blasts the refereeing decision that led to his first-ever red card,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Carragher-blasts-the-refereeing-decision-that-led-to-his-first-ever-red-card/3302137,1 day ago,"Jamie Carragher blasted the decision which led to his first-ever red card 25 years ago, joking that the incident was an example of 'great defending'.  The former defender was dismissed only three times in a Liverpool career that spanned nearly two decades and included over 700 appearances for the Merseyside club. Carragher was treated to a trip down memory lane during CBS's coverage of the Champions league this week, as he was made to relive the first of these indiscretions. The incident occurred during the second half of a top-flight clash against Charlton Athletic at the Valley, when Carragher, attempting to fend of the jostling Martin Pringle, caught the attacker with a flailing arm to the face. Referee Mike Reed opted to show the then 21-year-old a straight red, which he reacted to with some amazement. Nearly three decades later, his feelings on the matter are unchanged.  'How do you get red carded for that?' Carragher said on Tuesday night. 'I just get my arm across, great defending - what a coward you are. get up.' Gerard Houllier's side conceded the game's only goal just two minutes later through Keith Jones, as Charlton secured much-needed points in their fight against the drop. As for the Reds, they had put the French boss in sole charge after he had begun the season as joint-manager with Roy Evans. The peculiar arrangement was untenable and eventually fractured with the Reds' icon's departure in November 1998. Liverpool were made to endure a pretty miserable campaign in which they lost 14 games and finished seventh, though the next season yielded a fourth-place finish that built the foundation of their treble cup success a year later.","Liverpool were made to endure a pretty miserable campaign in which they lost 14 games and finished seventh, though the next season yielded a fourth-place finish that built the foundation of their treble cup success a year later."
173,Mourinho reveals which England 'golden generation' midfielder he REALLY prefers,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mourinho-reveals-which-England-golden-generation-midfielder-he-REALLY-prefers/3302223,1 day ago,"Jose Mourinho has waded into one of the most contentious debates in English football, offering his opinion on which of Paul Scholes, Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard was the superior player.  The Portuguese boss appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents Five podcast, a month on from his sacking by Serie A side Roma in January. Mourinho had led the side to their first-ever European trophy in 2022 but was dismissed following continued poor league form - and an increased level of ill-discipline on the touchline. Among the most successful periods of his career came during his first spell with Chelsea, where he formed a seemingly unbreakable bond with a squad that included Lampard. Therefore, it's little surprise the 61-year-old sided with the Blues legend, though he would not comment on which of the English trio was the better player.   'I cannot [chose], I cannot,' Mourinho said. 'If you ask me which one I prefer, Frank because he scored 500 goals for me. 'And the other ones, Scholes against me and Stevie G against me but phenomenal players.' During his first spell in charge at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho led Chelsea to consecutive Premier League titles with then record points totals. Lampard ascended to become one of the best players on the planet and even finished second - ahead of Gerrard - in 2005 Ballon d'or voting behind Ronaldinho. Mourinho claimed another top-flight English title on his return to Chelsea in 2015 before spells with Manchester United and Tottenham. During his revealing interview with the former Red Devil, the veteran coach discussed the oasis of world class options at England's disposal which, in his view, should have led to a major tournament win.  'To be honest I've always said, [with] Terry, Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, Ledley King, Jamie Carragher - who could not even get into the four - Scholes, Lampard, Gerrard, I was thinking.' 'We should have won something,' Ferdinand interrupted. 'You should,' continued Mourinho. 'But you were not far. When you lost to Portugal on penalties, I think that was the one for you.'","'You should,' continued Mourinho. 'But you were not far.

Kane has plundered 28 goals in as many games since joining Bayern in August, but struggled to make an impact as they were thrashed 3-0 by Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend. That defeat left Bayern, who have won 11 straight Bundesliga titles, in second, five points behind Leverkusen. The Champions League offers Kane and Co a chance to bounce back from that humiliating loss, and Tuchel says maximising the England captainâs influence will be key to doing just that tonight.  âIt was rare for Harry to have so few touches (against Leverkusen),â said Tuchel. âThe formation was actually thought of with him in mind, but we didnât find him at all. We want to get Harry in the game more, and we need to fix it. âIâm convinced we can show a reaction (against Lazio). It wasnât good enough in Leverkusen. But itâs a new opponent, a new competition. I hope we can make up for it.â","âIâm convinced we can show a reaction (against Lazio). It wasnât good enough in Leverkusen.

175,Pochettino insists Thiago Silva was only dropped against Villa to balance team,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Pochettino-insists-Thiago-Silva-was-only-dropped-against-Villa-to-balance-team/3300714,12 Feb,"Mauricio Pochettino showed his spiky side when quizzed on Thiago Silva as the Chelsea manager insisted his decision to drop the 39-year-old Brazilian was purely based on his team's balance - even if it came after his wife, Belle, called for his sacking on social media.  Pochettino used Benoit Badiashile and Axel Disasi in their FA Cup fourth-round replay at Aston Villa as the visitors secured a surprise win with this younger, quicker centre-back pairing. Ahead of facing Crystal Palace in the Premier League, Pochettino was asked if Silva's role will change ahead of his contract expiring at the end of the season, sparking an exchange in which the Argentinian jokingly offered his seat to the journalist so he could play manager. 'Why? Nothing happened,' Pochettino said. 'All the players are in the same position as him. We take a decision based on the performance. It is not different for him. I can only play with 11. If you want to change the rules, you can.' Asked if the youth and speed of Badiashile and Disasi made a difference against Villa, Pochettino said: 'That is your opinion. It is not a question because it is an affirmation. You are saying that I changed for two younger players that are faster than him.'  Asked again if their selection benefited his brand of football, Pochettino said: 'That is your opinion. That is not a question. If you believe that, why are you asking me? 'Why you are not sitting here? You can take my place? You can take the decision and you can pick the starting 11. No? You want to come here? 'I always take my decision trying to provide good balance to the team. I don't see the passport or the age of the player. Always it is about the quality, how we can get the best balance of the team. 'But from the beginning we were playing with him, without him, with Levi (Colwill), with Benoit when he was available. Benoit was not available for a long time. 'He was injured and now we need to assess him. (Trevoh) Chalobah was injured. (Wesley) Fofana was injured. Reece James was injured. Ben Chilwell, injured. Always we try to get the best balance for the formation and to pick the players that can perform and win games.'   Chelsea had a youthful look to their team without Silva, who turns 40 in September. 'I don't want to be the coach that picks the youngest team in England,' Pochettino added. 'We have young players. We need to build a team. You need to be more consistent like a team.' Pochettino is good pals with Palace boss Roy Hodgson, with both managers having felt the pressure of the Premier League this season from their supporters. 'From the beginning when I arrived at Southampton, he was the coach of the national team and he was always in watching games and sharing time with us and we created a very good relationship,' Pochettino added as he bids to end their losing run in the Premier League after defeats by Liverpool and Wolves.","'From the beginning when I arrived at Southampton, he was the coach of the national team and he was always in watching games and sharing time with us and we created a very good relationship,' Pochettino added as he bids to end their losing run in the Premier League after defeats by Liverpool and Wolves."

One of the most strongly linked is Hansi Flick, who is reportedly Spanish in case Joan Laporta should decide he is the man to lead them forward.  Nurnberg manager Cristian Fiel had been suggested as a potential member of his coaching staff in Catalonia, but he has shut down those rumours, laughing them off in declarations to BILD. Sport carried his words. âI wasnât smiling, I was laughing out loud,â he said when he heard or the news. âToday was my last day, I have my bags packed. Then I will send a card from Barcelona. My brother lives in Castelldefels. Iâll probably go to him first. He has a nice little house there.â With Flick, there are stronger links. He is rumoured to be one of the two best-positioned coaches in terms of who the Blaugrana like, and all of the reports from Germany are that he would be keen to take on the role. Flick has a curious coaching path, having been an assistant for most of his recent career, until taking over at Bayern Munich, and then Germany. With the former he had a brief but enormously successful spell, but flamed out of die Mannschaft.","Flick has a curious coaching path, having been an assistant for most of his recent career, until taking over at Bayern Munich, and then Germany.

177,Goalkeepers ânot exemptâ from sin bin plan and direct replacement not an option,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Goalkeepers-%E2%80%98not-exempt%E2%80%99-from-sin-bin-plan-and-direct-replacement-not-an-option/3300910,13 Feb,"Goalkeepers shown a blue card and sent to the sin bin cannot be directly replaced until their period of temporary dismissal ends, under protocols still to be published by the gameâs lawmakers â the PA news agency understands. Sin bin trial protocols developed by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) make provision for any player on the pitch, including goalkeepers, to be sent to the sin bin for dissent or a tactical foul. However, they do not extend to substitutes, substituted players or team officials such as a manager or coach. FIFA referees  Protocols designed to improve player behaviour, including sin bins, captain-only zones and cooling-off periods were set to be published on Friday but their publication has now been delayed indefinitely, pending further talks at the IFAB annual general meeting in early March. However, PA understands goalkeepers are not exempt from temporary dismissals and that no sin-binned player can be substituted until the temporary dismissal period has ended. That would mean a team whose goalkeeper was sin-binned would need to decide whether to bring on a substitute goalkeeper by taking off an outfield player to cover their absence for 10 minutes, or cope with an outfield player in goal during the period of temporary dismissal. If they went for the first of those options, they would then need to decide which goalkeeper to take off once the temporary dismissal period had ended and the original goalkeeper re-entered the pitch, assuming they had enough substitutions left. The delay in publication of the IFAB protocols came after multiple media reports surfaced on Thursday about the introduction of blue cards as part of sin bin trials. It was reported that a backlash against the idea contributed to the decision to delay, but no formal explanation for the decision to delay has been given by the IFAB. PA understands the trials were never intended to be introduced into the very top level of professional football during the initial trial phase. FIFAâs refereesâ chief Pierluigi Collina said in November, after approval was given at IFABâs annual business meeting for trial protocols to be drawn up, that the trials would âvery probablyâ involve professional football. âThe trial was very successful in a grassroots competition. Now we are talkingof a higher level, very probably professional or even high professional football,â the Italian said. âWe need to draft something that works or is worthy for top football.â At that time, PA understands there were initial expressions of interest in the sin bin trials from a number of Europeâs top leagues. FIFA wishes to clarify that reports of the so-called 'blue card' at elite levels of football are incorrect and premature. Any such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels, a position that FIFA intends to reiterate when thisâ¦ â FIFA Media (@fifamedia) February 8, 2024 The Football Association was also understood last week to be considering a trial in the menâs or womenâs FA Cup at some stage in the future. When reports concerning blue cards emerged on Thursday evening, a FIFA statement read: âFIFA wishes to clarify that reports of the so-called âblue cardâ at elite levels of football are incorrect and premature. âAny such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels, a position that FIFA intends to reiterate when this agenda item is discussed at the IFAB AGM on March 2.â","âAny such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels, a position that FIFA intends to reiterate when this agenda item is discussed at the IFAB AGM on March 2.â"

The visitors refused to give up in Catalonia as Lamine Yamalâs double eventually secured a point for the hosts. On a difficult night for Xavi Hernandezâs side, hereâs Football Espanaâs player ratings: Still looks to short on match rhythm. Struggled in possession and passing out from the back and conceded three goals. A shaky overall performance from the German star who is so often praised for his reliability. Did not look sharp, and is not trusted as a centre back currently, with a shuffle to right back. Has not stood out so far this season and struggling for form. Regularly sees passes which midfielders do not and showed good composure at times. At fault for Granadaâs second goal and part of a back line which conceded three against 19th placed Granada. A first start since coming back from injury and performed OK on his return. Passed well from defence and maintained a strong presence in the air. However, he is unable to command the defence as Ronald Araujo does. Registered another assist and continues to show his versatility. Failed to stop Pellistriâs cross for Granadaâs first goal and could not complete the full game. Tested in the midfield pivot role again but was replaced in the second half. Offered some stability in the midfield but needs more time to grow into the position. Unable to shut down the noise about his future with a quiet performance. Did not show his best version and unable to find key passes in the final third. Flashes of magic but still not back to his pre-injury level. Still has work to do to get back to 100%. The numbers show just how important he is for Barcelona. An assist for Lewandowskiâs goal brings his tally to 10+ assists in a single season for the first time in his career. Started once again and scored inside the first 15 minutes. When Barcelona needed him, he was there again late on, with a brilliant leveller. Despite being 16, he is Barcelonaâs biggest attacking threat and that says a lot. Missed an easy chance just before 1-1 and forced a great save from the Granada goal keeper. A few uncertain moments, but scored to make it 2-2, to get Barcelona back level. Added some intensity and saw a goal ruled out for offside. Returned from injury and played in an unfamiliar left sided role. Had a big chance to win it for Barcelona late on but headed over.",Had a big chance to win it for Barcelona late on but headed over.
179,Arsenal building momentum in Premier League title battle â Mikel Arteta,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-building-momentum-in-Premier-League-title-battle-%E2%80%93-Mikel-Arteta/3300130,12 Feb,"Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal are gaining momentum in the title race after they roared to a 6-0 win at West Ham. The Gunners backed up last weekâs big triumph over Liverpool with another statement victory, their biggest away win in the Premier League. Their title bid hit the buffers in this fixture last season when they blew a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 but there was no chance of a repeat after William Saliba headed them in front and West Ham promptly collapsed. Declan Rice, second left, scores Arsenalâs sixth goal  Declan Rice grabbed a pair of assists against his former club while Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Magalhaes and Leandro Trossard were also on target, all before half-time. Saka scored his second midway through the second half and Rice rubbed salt in the wounds with a long-range sixth. âWe are maintaining and building some momentum now,â said Gunners boss Arteta. âPerformances have been strong as well as results in recent weeks. We need to maintain that because other teams are doing that as well. We are not the only ones.â It was a chastening afternoon for West Ham and manager David Moyes pulled no punches after his heaviest defeat in charge. âIt was a really poor day for us, very difficult to explain really,â he said. David Moyes  âArsenal played extremely well, give them credit, but itâs difficult to explain how we played so poorly. âWeâre normally a lot stronger, we didnât show that today. Iâm disappointed with the way we fell apart when the game hadnât looked as if it was going to be as big as that. âI donât think since Iâve come back to the club my teamâs defended that way, ever. We were weak today, we didnât do our jobs well enough, we didnât fight to contain it harder. âIâve had teams here which maybe havenât had the same quality that we have now but we would have made sure we didnât put in a performance like that, thatâs for sure.â When West Ham beat Arsenal and Manchester United in December, there was talk of a Champions League challenge. They have lost to both in the past eight days, shipping nine goals in the process, and are still without a win in 2024. Alarm bells might not be ringing for Moyes just yet, but the sight of hundreds of West Ham fans leaving at half-time told a sorry tale and the Scot cannot keep dining out on last seasonâs Europa Conference League success forever. West Hamâs Declan Rice, left, and manager David Moyes lift the Europa Conference League trophy  âTo be a football supporter, and especially at this club â I came back twice to keep them out of relegation â thereâs always going to be bad times,â he added. âIt was only a few months ago we were having probably the best time West Ham have ever had. âProbably the last three years have been as good a time as West Ham have had. Sixth, seventh in the league, a semi-final in Europe, a final. âI still think this club has grown and undoubtedly weâve had a terrible day today. I totally understand them leaving but at football clubs youâre going to have bad days. I certainly wouldnât forget the good ones.â",âI still think this club has grown and undoubtedly weâve had a terrible day today.

It was a ruthless performance from Los Blancos, made all the better by the fact that they ended Gironaâs 15-match unbeaten streak in La Liga with the victory, and also the Catalan sideâs unbeaten away record in the competition. It was even more impressive considering that they had Dani Carvajal and Aurelien Tchouameni playing as centre-backs due to the unavailability of Nacho Fernandez and Antonio Rudiger. Carlo Ancelotti was ecstatic after the match, and he lauded several of his players as being the best in the world, as per Relevo. Vinicius Junior, who was man of the match at the Bernabeu, was singled out as his number one. âWhen he plays like this, with this attitude, for me heâs the best player in the world. Jude Bellingham, second; Rodrygo, third; Toni Kroos, fourth; Eduardo Camavinga, fifth; Federico Valverde, sixth.â Youâd be hard pressed to dispute Ancelottiâs sentiments, especially in regards to Vinicius. He may have had a somewhat difficult season so far for Real Madrid due to injury troubles, but his class is permanent.","Youâd be hard pressed to dispute Ancelottiâs sentiments, especially in regards to Vinicius.

The Blaugrana defence continues to look fragile, and now he is being publicly criticised.  Cubarsi went down after a supposed stamp from Granada goalkeeper Agustin Batalla in the box, but nothing was given. No contact was immediately obvious from the footage provided. On Cadena Cope, veteran journalist Paco Gonzalez did not hold back on Cubarsi, explaining that his father should pick him up and lay down the law for him. Which was not taken well by Cubarsiâs teammate Gavi, who was in the stands to watch the 3-3 draw as he recovers from his injury. Gavi replied to the clip of Gonzalezâs criticism on Instagram saying âPathetic is what you are, smarten up Paco.â  Cubarsi has certainly come into the side at a rough time,  as Xavi Hernandez desperately searches for the answers to their issues. In particular, his position on the pitch is perhaps the most exposed to criticism, perhaps with the exception of the goalkeeping position.","Cubarsi has certainly come into the side at a rough time,  as Xavi Hernandez desperately searches for the answers to their issues.

182,Crystal Palace 'suffer blow in their pursuit of Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Crystal-Palace-suffer-blow-in-their-pursuit-of-Ipswich-boss-Kieran-McKenna/3301378,2 days ago,"Crystal Palace have reportedly failed to poach Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna as he is reluctant to jump ship with his side in the Premier League promotion hunt.  Chairman Steve Parish spoke with McKenna's camp but he is unwilling to leave with Ipswich fourth in the Championship, while Palace are 15th in the top flight. Palace still hope he could take the reins at the end of the season and Parish would prefer to replace Hodgson then, but McKenna won't commit to that due to Ipswich's current upward trajectory, as per The Guardian. They are also reportedly monitoring Oliver Glasner, the Austrian who led Eintracht Frankfurt to Europa League glory and a domestic cup final before leaving in June 2023, according to The Telegraph. Hodgson has insisted Palace can emerge from their 'bad period' before their season crumbles but a run of four wins in 18 Premier League games has heightened the threat of relegation.  The mood has soured among the Eagles faithful in recent weeks, with furious fans unfurling banners blaming 'wasted potential' and 'weak decisions' after the 5-0 loss to Arsenal last month. Hodgson narrowly avoided being struck by a missile launched from the Selhurst Park stands earlier this year and afterwards claimed supporters had been 'spoiled' by the club in recent years. This is Palace's longest continuous run in the top flight in their history, now on to their 11th-straight season following promotion in 2013. However, a talented crop of players including Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise has often looked shackled and they have slumped to 15th in the table, just five points above the drop zone. They took the lead against Chelsea on Monday night but conceded an equaliser just after the break and capitulated in stoppage time, shipping twice to surrender a point. Conor Gallagher scored twice against his old club to fuel the Blues' comeback and condemn Palace to a third league defeat in four games. Hodgson has labelled this the 'toughest period' of his career but will be desperate to see out the job at a club who he has led to a generally stable Premier League stint. Meanwhile, Ipswich boss McKenna is on the up and can seemingly do no wrong.    The former Manchester United coach led Ipswich to second place and automatic promotion from League One last campaign after they had had endured three average seasons. Now they are competing with recent Premier League drop-outs Southampton and Leeds United for second place in the Championship. More broadly, McKenna has reinvigorated Ipswich with optimism after years of mediority and dismay. Last week, when asked about stories linking him to Palace, he said: 'My full focus and commitment is with Ipswich and the season that we're having and the next game ahead.'","Last week, when asked about stories linking him to Palace, he said: 'My full focus and commitment is with Ipswich and the season that we're having and the next game ahead.'"

On Thursday, it was reported that the 24-year-old has told Paris Saint-Germain that he is leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season, while also telling Los Blancos that he intends to sign.  Mbappeâs impending arrival means that Real Madridâs star-studded attack will be all-but complete. He will join Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham, Brahim Diaz, Joselu Mato and Arda Guler in being attacking options for head coach Carlo Ancelotti, although this may be too much for president Florentino Perez. MD have claimed that Mbappe will replace Rodrygo in the Real Madrid team, provides that his signing is finalised. Furthermore, they also say that the 23-year-old could even be sold in the summer as a result. In reality, it would be very unlikely to see Real Madrid part ways with Rodrygo. Thereâs no doubt that heâs had an inconsistent season so far, but he is a quality footballer, and playing alongside Mbappe will only make him better too.","In reality, it would be very unlikely to see Real Madrid part ways with Rodrygo.

Gundogan, previously Sara Arfaoui, started dating Barcelona and Germany star Ilkay Gundogan in 2021 before they tied the knot a year later. They have one son together, Kais, who was born in March 2023. She is one of the stars of Prime Video's new series Married To The Game which follows the lives of five football WAGS, aiming to give an insight into the reality of dating a top-level footballer. Sara was a highly-successful TV presenter and model before meeting Ilkay, while she also featured in several films and was a reality TV star. However, since marrying Ilkay and originally moving to Manchester, before relocating again this summer, Sara's career has had to take a back-seat and the 28-year-old opened up on the challenges she has faced.   'As a wife sometimes you are on the side,' she exclusively told Mail Sport. 'But it was hard because despite my work as a TV presenter, the fact I speak six languages and travelled the world as a model, when I was him, everything I did, suddenly it became zero and I just became his wife. 'The people knew me before as a media star but when I became a wife, there is the tendency of the press to show wives of players in a certain way and it's like we have to fit this cliche. 'I lost a bit my spontaneity, my way of speaking without thinking. So yeah, it's a bit hard, because you have to also rebuild yourself and find your own identity. 'It's kind of sad because there is no other sport, there is nothing similar, say in cinema or politics, that will describe a wife of an important politician that way.' Sara went onto explain how she has had to turn down several career opportunities back in Italy since her son was born, reflecting on the balancing act of prioritising herself, while also supporting her family.   And she insisted that despite the outside perception, being a WAG is not always as rosy at it seems. 'It's tough (to balance everything), because I have given up so much. The hard part is always people tend to imagine we have everything because we are with this successful man. 'But a successful man has his own career. He is successful. It doesn't bring success to you. Looking at yourself in the mirror and feeling like I'm doing something is a much nicer feeling than just having a lifestyle because of someone else. 'Doing things by yourself and being successful is more important than having material things. It's important to be proud of myself and you cannot be proud of yourself when you're not doing work.' She continued: 'It felt like when I was in Manchester, my whole life was around football. 'Because my friends were from football, the people I've met through my husband, and then I didn't have anything that was just my world outside of that. 'I spent my life last year working on my English which is important and then now I live in Spain and you have to rebuild everything again. 'This is the difficult part that every year you're somewhere else and everything you build, you have to do it again and again.' Sara is now slowly returning to her previous career after dealing with the tough adaptation to WAG life.  And, while she admits patience will be required, the 28-year-old is enjoying putting herself out there again. She added: 'It's different, because when you've been out of this world, for a bit of time, you have to kind of start again which is not easy. '(The filming) was a really nice experience, because I had the chance to show a bit of who I am, not only what people read about me. 'It was an opportunity to show a bit of my personality.'",'It was an opportunity to show a bit of my personality.'

Juve are seeking to bounce back after last week's defeat to Inter Milan. Allegri said: ""We must try to get back to winning ways tomorrow against a team that in terms of quality and performance does not deserve to be in its current position. Udinese are a physical side with players like Lorenzo Lucca, Florian Thauvin and Lazar Samardzic who provide technique and a good shot on target. âLook, it is no secret that Inter were the favourites for the Scudetto. We picked up 53 points, we must get back to winning ways tomorrow and break away from fifth place. Inter are doing extraordinary things, I think they won all seven competitive games in 2024. We just have to keep taking it one step at a time."" On their defeat to Inter, Allegri said: âTheir win ought to make us even more motivated to get back to -4. You can lose a head-to-head, it happens, and one match should not make us throw away all the good work done in these months. If anything, we learned a great deal from that game. âI analysed it, that was a balanced encounter, there was a Federico Dimarco chance, the Marcus Thuram goal, but then we wasted the Vlahovic opportunity. It was wide open after the break, we threatened both to score and concede. âAt this moment, the strongest team is at the top of the table.

Arsenal's two recognised central strikers, Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah, have just 14 goals between them in all competitions this term. Mikel Arteta's side got on just fine without the pair on Sunday, though, putting six goals past West Ham with Leandro Trossard starting through the middle. That victory at the London Stadium ensured Arsenal remain in touch with Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. They also have 53 goals, just three short of top scorers City. Arteta's team will face multiple big tests if they are to claim European glory this term, with Porto awaiting in the round of 16. With a title challenge alongside the Champions League campaign, Henry remains concerned about his former club's finishing, but recognises they have been able to deliver at some key moments. ""I just think that... there was a massive discussion about 'does Arsenal need a number nine?'. What they needed to do is put the ball in the back of the net,"" Henry said on CBS Sports Golazo. ""When Arsenal does put the ball in the back of the net it's 6-0. In every game it could have been the same - in the cup against Liverpool they didn't do it, they did it with a bit of help in the league from Liverpool - but when Arsenal are on point and put the ball in the back of the net, it doesn't matter who plays. ""Trossard will score, Declan Rice has been scoring, Gabriel has been scoring, so it doesn't really matter. If we turn our opportunities into goals, we are going to be - I think - a very difficult team to beat."" Arsenal's win on Sunday was their fourth on the spin in the Premier League, but that run has come without European distractions. The first leg against Porto comes either side of league games against Burnley and Newcastle, while the second leg in March is flanked by London derbies against Brentford and Chelsea. ""Having said that, the draw is going to be tough,"" Henry continued. ""Obviously Porto [next] then after that you can meet a team from your country, then it depends on the path... it's a massive if, because Porto will be tough, [but you can] play Man City, you have to beat maybe a Madrid if they go through. ""How are you going to deal with that if you're still competing also in the league to win it. Those are the questions that we're going to have to answer, or the team has to answer, but for me it wasn't down to not having the nine scoring - yes the front three wasn't scoring..., but it was about putting the ball in the back of the net and when we do we are hard to beat.""","""How are you going to deal with that if you're still competing also in the league to win it.

Gallagher netted twice against Palace, where he spent last season on loan, with the second goal coming just after 90 minutes to give Chelsea a 2-1 lead. Fernandez secured the points in the fourth minute of added time at Selhurst Park to leave Palace just five points above the relegation zone and pile the pressure on manager Roy Hodgson. Chelsea climbed to 10th place in the Premier League. Mail Sport's Kieran Gill rated the players. Djordje Petrovic â 6 No chance of stopping the swerving 25-yard screamer, but did well to deny Matheus Franca after Chelsea's defence parted like the red sea at 1-1. Malo Gusto â 5.5 Not his greatest first half as Crystal Palace had some joy down his side, but provided the cross for Conor Gallagher to eventually equalise so played his part. Axel Disasi â 5 One of a few culprits who lost the ball too carelessly, as Disasi struggled to follow up his dominant showing against Aston Villa. Thiago Silva â 6 Back in the Chelsea line-up following his dropping at Villa Park but replaced by Levi Colwill after picking up an injury on the hour mark. Ben Chilwell â 6.5 Unlike Gusto on the opposite side, Chilwell was largely untroubled by Jordan Ayew, as the captain had his flank on lockdown.  Moises Caicedo â 4.5 Weak in challenges, including in the build-up to Crystal Palaceâs opener, and did not show the passing of a Â£115million midfielder overall. Must do better. Enzo Fernandez â 7.5 Much more assured on the ball than his midfield partner and used his freedom to pop up in advanced positions, showing lovely composure for Chelsea's third. Noni Madueke â 4 Dawdling on the ball allowed Tyrick Mitchell to take it from him before Jefferson Lermaâs scorcher. Hooked at half-time, summing up his sorry night. Conor Gallagher â 8 Chelsea's saviour. Equalised at the start of the second half after a clever burst into the box and then secured the win with a smart 18-yard finish. Nicolas Jackson â 5.5 Struggled with limited service. His replacement, Raheem Sterling, made more of an impact in truth as he helped Chelsea take the lead in stoppage time.  Cole Palmer â 7 Much more comfortable when operating from the wing as can look lost up top, and two stoppage-time assists helped Chelsea secure this victory.

Pep Guardiolaâs side dominated in every aspect at the Danish capitalâs famously atmospheric Parken Stadium and Phil Foden completed a deserved success late on. Bernardo Silva scores Manchester Cityâs second goal  With close to 80 per cent possession, the holders were hardly troubled and will be confident of wrapping up a place in the quarter-finals when the sides meet again in Manchester in three weeks. The only real downside for City was the loss of Jack Grealish through injury in the first half. Despite having almost complete control, one thing City could not do was silence the home fans. As anticipated, Copenhagenâs raucous following produced an intimidating atmosphere and greeted every City attack with loud whistles and even a siren. Yet it appeared to have no effect on City, who immediately imposed themselves and should have taken the lead when De Bruyne fluffed a header from a Nathan Ake cross. Ruben Dias also forced a save from Kamil Grabara and Ake fired the rebound over, although a raised flag suggested neither might have counted. Copenhagen, their rustiness amid Denmarkâs long winter break evident, were struggling to live with City and it came as no surprise when De Bruyne hit his 11th-minute opener. The Belgian, who has quickly eased back into gear after a long injury lay-off, timed his run onto a Foden pass superbly and finished clinically with a low shot. City looked hungry for more and Erling Haaland was inches away from meeting a De Bruyne cross before a Silva ball was deflected onto the woodwork by Denis Vavro. City suffered a blow when Grealish, making his first start in six games, was forced off after 21 minutes soon after a challenge from Diogo Goncalves but his replacement Jeremy Doku added more energy to Cityâs attack. Within moments of coming on Doku set up Haaland for what would have been a spectacular goal with a volleyed cross but the Norwegianâs overhead kick flew over. City looked capable of running up a huge score but remarkably found themselves level when Ederson gifted the hosts an equaliser on 34 minutes. The goalkeeper passed straight to Mohamed Elyounoussi and, although the former Southampton forwardâs shot was blocked, debutant Mattson followed up with a fine finish. Mattson, a recent signing from NEC Nijmegen, almost added another soon after but blazed over. The home fans were animated but their excitement was not to last. Silva restored normal order before the break with a fine flicked finish after De Bruyne got the better of Mattson to pick out the Portuguese. De Bruyne almost added to the lead early in the second half when he tested Grabara before Haaland headed tamely at the keeper and Foden had an effort deflected wide. Grabara also pushed away a long-range Doku strike and Haaland was twice denied by the keeper in stoppage time before Foden wrapped up the win after exchanging passes with De Bruyne.",Grabara also pushed away a long-range Doku strike and Haaland was twice denied by the keeper in stoppage time before Foden wrapped up the win after exchanging passes with De Bruyne.
189,Three Copenhagen stars to watch as they play host to Manchester City,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Three-Copenhagen-stars-to-watch-as-they-play-host-to-Manchester-City/3301134,13 Feb,"Copenhagen face an uphill battle from the first whistle when they take on Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday.  Jacob Neestrup's side haven't even played a competitive game in 2024, with their last outing coming in their win over Galatasary to book a place in the competition's last 16 back in December. However, Pep Guardiola would be wise not to take the Danes lightly, as they have already defeated Manchester United and held Bayern Munich and Harry Kane to a goalless draw this season. If they are to get a result on home soil, they will need to be at their very best and firing on all cylinders. Mail Sport has picked out three players that could be key to the hosts securing what would be a historic upset. The teenager who downed Manchester United earlier in the season with an 87th-minute winner. Bardghji is already attracting interest from a host of European giants and has been linked with Tottenham and Chelsea in recent weeks. Likely to be an option to alter the game off the bench and thrives in wide areas. Already has 12 goals in 28 league starts for Copenhagen.  Signed from Viborg for around Â£2.5million last summer, Achouri is a player who can really unsettle defences. A strong dribbler and the quickest among Jacob Neestrupâs ranks, the 25-year-old Tunisia international causes danger with his direct style off the left-hand side. It should be a good physical battle with Cityâs Kyle Walker.  The skipper and older head in the midfield. At 32, Claesson is enjoying the best spell of his career â one spent at Elfsborg in his native Sweden and then FK Krasnodar in Russia â before making the switch to the Danish capital two years ago. Will need to lean on his experience to help him deal with Manchester Cityâs runners from central areas. ",
190,Bellingham 'could miss 4 matches for alleged shocking insult aimed at Greenwood',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Bellingham-could-miss-4-matches-for-alleged-shocking-insult-aimed-at-Greenwood/3301802,2 days ago,"Jude Bellingham could miss up to four Real Madrid games if it is ruled that the England star did call Mason Greenwood a 'rapist' during their game two weeks ago.  Footage circulating on social media led fans to believe they noticed Bellingham mutter the insult at the Getafe forward when the two sides came up against each other at the start of February. Greenwood's club reported Bellingham for the second-half incident, and an expert report has been produced to try and understand what happened during the heated clash. COPE report that the Real Madrid star could be sanctioned for up to four games, according to the regulations, if it is deemed that he did utter the alleged insult to Greenwood. The Spanish outlet also report that the Spanish FA's Competition Committee already has possession of the report from a lip-reading expert, after it was ordered by RFEF in the days following the incident.  Expert witness and forensic lip-reader Jeremy Freeman had told Mail Sport that he is '97 per cent confident' that Bellingham did mouth the insult at Greenwood during their meeting on Thursday February 1. The next step will see an investigating judge gather all the available information about what happened, and in about 15 days, they will propose for a sanction, or a dismissal of Getafe's complaint, depending on their conclusion. From there, the clubs will have a further 10 business days to present their own cases. A goal from Joselu in each half gave Real Madrid a 2-0 away win over Getafe, which they have since followed up with a draw against Atletico Madrid and an impressive 4-0 victory over Girona on Saturday. Bellingham injured his left ankle in the win over Girona, and will be out for about three weeks, but he is expected to be available for England's games against Brazil and Belgium in March.  Greenwood mutually agreed to leave former side Manchester United on loan following the conclusion of an internal investigation into the player's conduct. Greenwood had previously been charged with attempted rape, assault, and coercive behaviour in January 2022, but the charges were dropped in February 2023 by the Crown Prosecution Service following the withdrawal of key witnesses.","Greenwood had previously been charged with attempted rape, assault, and coercive behaviour in January 2022, but the charges were dropped in February 2023 by the Crown Prosecution Service following the withdrawal of key witnesses."
191,Jose Mourinho reveals he could have become Portugal and England manager,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Jose-Mourinho-reveals-he-could-have-become-Portugal-and-England-manager/3302232,1 day ago,"Jose Mourinho has revealed he was offered the chance to manage England and Portugal during a chat with Rio Ferdinand.  Over the years, Mourinho has worked his way into becoming one of the finest managers of his generation. Throughout his illustrious career, the Portuguese has taken charge of clubs such as Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Roma. Mourinho has often been linked with managing an international team, with the man himself claiming he was offered the chance to manage England. During a chat with former United and Three Lions defender Ferdinand, Mourinho said: âI refused great working opportunities. âThe first one was even very very hard to refuse because it was Portugal.â He continued: âI could be their coach in the national team, also yours. âI had it there, on the table.â At this point, Ferdinand put his hand on his face and said: âNo way!â Most recently, the 61-year-old was the manager of Italian Serie A side Roma. Mourinho led the team to their first trophy in 14 years after taking them all the way in the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2022. However, after a string of disappointing performances in the 23/24 season which resulted in four defeats in seven games, Mourinho was sacked by Roma last month. A Roma statement read in full: ""We would like to thank Jose on behalf of all of us at AS Roma for his passion and efforts since his arrival at the club. ""We will always have great memories of his tenure at Roma, but we believe that an immediate change is in the best interests of the club. ""We wish Jose and his assistants all the best in their future endeavours."" Since then, the 'Special One' has been linked with a move to the Saudi Professional League, as well as a return to Chelsea.","Since then, the 'Special One' has been linked with a move to the Saudi Professional League, as well as a return to Chelsea."
192,Erik ten Hag says Sir Jim Ratcliffe has lifted the mood at Manchester United,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Erik-ten-Hag-says-Sir-Jim-Ratcliffe-has-lifted-the-mood-at-Manchester-United/3302218,1 day ago,"Erik ten Hag hailed Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS for changing the mood around Manchester United - but revealed he is not being consulted over changes off the pitch.  United are pushing to make Dan Ashworth their inaugural sporting director, while Omar Berrada has been poached from Manchester City to take charge as CEO. Ratcliffe and INEOS are taking charge of football operations at Old Trafford but any suggestion boardroom personnel will be green lit by Ten Hag were dismissed. 'I'm here and I know what construction I am working in and I'm very happy,' he said. 'I don't know anything about changes. I talk with the new sporting organisation but it's not up to me. I am working and that is my focus at the moment, working with this team.'  Harry Maguire said this week how impressed players were with Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford during a recent Carrington visit and Ten Hag echoed the thoughts of his centre back. 'Yeah, you feel that ambition, it brings the mood and the spirit,' he said. 'I think the players and the staff are very aligned with the ambitions of INEOS. 'We want to win and to achieve the highest. We are very aligned and we have to execute to prove the ambitions.' The pursuit of Ashworth makes for an interesting dynamic, although a sporting director is not alien to Ten Hag given he worked so successfully with Marc Overmars at Ajax. 'I think it's important you are on the same page, with the same philosophy about the profiles of the players you need,' he said. 'It's important to have good communication so you get the right players. 'It's one of the most important factors to develop a good team that you have the right players, the right characters, so that means you have to do a lot of work. It's a long process to get the right players in.'    He continued: 'When things change [INEOS] will tell me. As I said in a club like Manchester United, you can't do everything alone, it's impossible. You need very good people around you. 'A club like Man United always has to look for better, never be satisfied, good is not good enough, and always try to do better, every day better than before.'","'A club like Man United always has to look for better, never be satisfied, good is not good enough, and always try to do better, every day better than before.'"
193,Manchester Unitedâs billion-pound squad breaks UEFA record,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Manchester-United%E2%80%99s-billion-pound-squad-breaks-UEFA-record/3302035,1 day ago,"Manchester Unitedâs squad at the end of last season was the most expensively-assembled on record, according to a UEFA report. The Red Devilsâ squad at 2023âs financial year-end cost a collective 1.42 billion euros (Â£1.21bn) in transfer fees, eclipsing the figure of 1.33 billion euros recorded by Real Madrid in 2020. The United squad at the end of 2022-23 included Â£82million Brazilian winger Antony, Â£80m England defender Harry Maguire, Â£73m signing Jadon Sancho and the Â£60m Brazil midfielder Casemiro. Jadon Sancho was one of a number of expensive acquisitions in the Manchester United squad at the end of the 2023 financial year  Further recruits last summer such as Mason Mount, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund are not counted within the figures. UEFAâs European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report found three other clubsâ squads â Manchester City, Chelsea and Real Madrid â cost more than one billion euros in transfer fees in their most recently disclosed financial year-end figures. Chelseaâs most recent figures go up to the year end June 30, 2022, and therefore do not include their heavy spending in the summer of that year or the January 2023 window. United have become one of 15 English top-flight clubs recognised within the report as being part of a multi-club investment group, with the purchase of a 25 per cent stake by Ineos founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe almost complete. Ineos also holds majority stakes in French side Nice and Swiss club Lausanne. In all, 105 top-division European clubs (13 per cent of the total number) have a cross-investment relationship with one or more other clubs, the report found. Sir Jim Ratcliffe outside Old Trafford  There were 31 purchases of majority stakes and seven purchases of minority stakes in 2023 by groups holding a stake in at least one other European club, according to the report. However, less than one transfer per club on average is actually executed within the same multi-club structure, the report found. As the size of multi-club investment groups has increased, that proportion has even decreased (0.6 transfers per club in 2023 compared to 0.8 in 2021), suggesting the multi-club investment trend is not entirely driven by player transfer considerations. Andrea Traverso, UEFAâs director of financial sustainability and research, said: âMore than 300 clubs are part of multi-club investment groups, leading to an increased risk of seeing two clubs with the same owner or investor facing each other in the same competition, creating potential integrity risks at the European level. âThe current context demands strict enforcement of cost control regulations and more harmonisation of financial rules between leagues. This is paramount to limit overspending, âcreative financeâ, and rules circumvention. âAs long as differences on key regulatory matters continue between leagues, inflationary tensions will persist, contributing to imbalances and instability.â Elsewhere, the report found spending on player wages dropped by 1.1 per cent among the clubs with the 20 largest player wage bills, with United spending 88m euros (Â£75m) less on player wages in 2023 compared to the year before. Barcelona and City had large increases in player wages spending â 158m euros and 68m euros (Â£134.8m and Â£58m) respectively.","Elsewhere, the report found spending on player wages dropped by 1.1 per cent among the clubs with the 20 largest player wage bills, with United spending 88m euros (Â£75m) less on player wages in 2023 compared to the year before.

194,Arsenal destroy West Ham as Declan Rice dominates old side on return - 5 talking points,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-destroy-West-Ham-as-Declan-Rice-dominates-old-side-on-return---5-talking-points/3300702,12 Feb,"Arsenal's title tilt rolls on after the Gunners decimated West Ham with a 6-0 win that included four first-half goals.  With title rivals Manchester City and Liverpool both recording wins on Saturday afternoon, the pressure was on Mikel Arteta's men to do the same. Gunners' record signing Declan Rice was the subject of some boos early on both ahead of kick-off and each time he was in possession, there was no animosity in the other direction though, with the midfielder applauding Hammers fans while making his way over to take a corner. Arsenal eventually made their early pressure count, with William Saliba on hand to nod home from Rice's corner. Moments later, Bukayo Saka put last season's West Ham penalty demons to bed, doing what he couldn't last time to score his spot-kick after being brought down by Areola. Arteta's side weren't done there, with Rice registering another assist after Gabriel Magalhaes got on the scoresheet once again. The Brazil international was left with far too much space and followed in the footsteps of his centre-back partner to head Arsenal into a three-goal cushion. And yet, even more was to come before the half-time whistle. Martin Odegaard found Leandro Trossard with a neat pass and the Belgium international did the rest, lashing home the pick of the bunch to all but end the tie as a contest before the interval. The Gunners smelt blood in the second-half and if Saka's second, Arsenal's fifth annoyed the home fans - Rice firing home a thunderbolt from outside of the box certainly stung. So comfortable were Arsenal, that Arteta even opted to hand 16-year-old Ethan Nwaneri some minutes before the end. Mirror Football has analysed five talking points from one of Arsenal's most impressive victories this season over a dismal West Ham side. Arteta's decision to hire set-piece coach Nicolas Jover has proved to be an inspired on, with seemingly every dead-ball ending up in a goal for Arsenal at the moment. This term, the Gunners are the Premier League's most lethal team from set-pieces, with a stunning 17 goals. The first of the afternoon came when Rice's corner found the head of Saliba, after every Arsenal attacker took up a unique deep position, with a plethora of yellow shirts all occupying the back-post. The sight of Jover striding forward to the top of the technical area for every corner and free-kick is now a common one. Whatever message he is relaying is clearly working, with Arsenal converting from a free-kick three minutes after Saka had scored from the spot. Gabriel Magalhaes, who is never one to shy away from popping up with a goal, got his fourth goal of the campaign. From that point onwards, each Arsenal corner and free-kick drew a nervous gasp from sections of the West Ham faithful who feared the worst. When he decided to leave West Ham for a Premier League and indeed London rival in Arsenal, Rice would have been well aware it would divide opinion among the Hammers faithful. With that being said, itâs likely heâd have also dreamed of a triumphant return to his old stomping ground when the time came to take on West Ham at the London Stadium. November saw Rice come off the bench during a 3-1 Carabao Cup defeat, but this was the one that really mattered. This time, he put in a trademark combative display in the middle of the park, mixed with the technical flair that justifies Riceâs Â£105m price-tag. Dominating and dictating proceedings at his pace, the former Hammer even managed to get himself two assists after his corner and free-kicks were nodded home by Saliba and Gabriel respectively. ""10 more years, 10 more years Declan Rice"" rung out from the away end, to add further insult to injury for the home fans. Imagine their delight when he whipped in Arsenal's sixth from distance. He didn't celebrate, though the goal was worthy of one and was soon hauled off. While making his way off the pitch, Rice was applauded by the fans that once worshipped him, and he returned the gesture. By now, it is blindingly obvious to just about everyone that Saka is one of the Premier League's finest attacking talents. There is now a discussion to be had over whether he is Arsenal's finest ever academy graduate. Of course, he doesn't boast the honours list of Ashley Cole or even Cesc Fabregas (if he counts), but time and time again when his side need him most, it is Saka who steps up. He had the courage to take the penalty in the first-half despite last season's nightmare, while his second was something that no 'keeper could have stopped. Arsenalâs victory means West Hamâs run of zero wins across all competitions in 2024 continues, only increasing the pressure on manager David Moyes. The Hammers boss has been the subject of criticism in recent weeks, with some suggesting it would be best for both parties to separate come the end of the season. While this result will only reinforce the belief of those who have that stance, West Hamâs season to date has been a difficult one to analyse. For all of the doom and gloom, a win today would have meant the Hammers had managed the same amount of wins this term as they had across the entirety of last season (11). With that being said, the loud ""Ole's"" that rung out from the away end would have been difficult for even the biggest Moyes believer to swallow. To concede six on your own turf to a direct London rival, while your former captain scores the sixth, was enough to inspire a mass exodus long before Craig Pawson blew the full-time whistle. If fans of Manchester City and Liverpool thought this season would be a return to the norm and see just the two of them battle it out for the title, it looks like they have another thing coming. Keen to prove last seasonâs title tilt wasnât a fluke, Artetaâs Arsenal look if anything more qualified to win the league this time around. This was a dominant victory at a ground that has given the Gunners plenty of headaches recently, sending a message to their title rivals in the process. After a difficult spell between Christmas and New Year, Arteta was well aware his side needed an inspired run of form. They have now recorded four league wins from four since the turn of the year. Last term saw Arsenal operate as pace setters for the bulk of the season, but these last few weeks would suggest the Gunners are more comfortable being part of the chasing pack as they aim to hit form at just the right time.","Last term saw Arsenal operate as pace setters for the bulk of the season, but these last few weeks would suggest the Gunners are more comfortable being part of the chasing pack as they aim to hit form at just the right time."

UEFA has again increased the pot for bonus payments through the competition, with last yearâs total after winning the showpiece final around Â£85m. City took home just over Â£2m a game in the group stage after finishing top with six consecutive victories against RB Leipzig, Young Boys and Red Star Belgrade. Should they consolidate the 3-1 advantage over Copenhagen in next monthâs last-16 second leg, Pep Guardiolaâs side will earn a further Â£9m for reaching the quarter finals for a seventh season on the trot. City will also be due a sizeable figure for a larger share of the broadcast finances given both Manchester United and Newcastle United failed to qualify for the knockout stages.   And there is another Â£33m on offer in prizes for progressing through the various rounds this term, while the winners of the final are actually only afforded just under Â£4m for lifting the trophy. Guardiola has been positive about Cityâs chances this term, suggesting that last yearâs success has given them additional belief. Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden scored as they eased Copenhagen aside on Tuesday night with City now firm favourites to make the last eight. âWeâve got the squad of players [to win it again],â Foden said. âI look around the changing room and still see the determination and hunger â so I donât see why not.â","âWeâve got the squad of players [to win it again],â Foden said. âI look around the changing room and still see the determination and hunger â so I donât see why not.â"

City have won their last 10 matches in all competitions and are gathering a momentum that could be ominous for their rivals as they bid to repeat their glorious treble of last year. Their current run started without the influence of the talismanic pairing of De Bruyne and Haaland as both nursed injuries. Nathan Ake  Yet both are now back in business, as seen in Saturdayâs hard-fought 2-0 win over Everton in which Haaland scored both and De Bruyne created one, and City are looking tough to stop. Defender Ake said: âWe know how good both of them are and when Kevin came on, straight away he looked for Erling. They looked for each other. âItâs massive that theyâre both fit, both ready to go and itâs good to see that weâre doing well. âItâs just a lift to see everyone back â we havenât had that for a while â especially the players who can make differences in tight games like this. Itâs massive for us.â De Bruyne missed most of the first half of the season following hamstring surgery but has been eased back into action over the past month. Ake is surprised how well the Belgian playmaker has hit the ground running. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  pic.twitter.com/EGNlXlRcCh â Erling Haaland (@ErlingHaaland) February 10, 2024 The Dutchman said: âIf youâre out for five or six months normally it takes you a little bit of time but straight away heâs been ready to go, from the first moment. âI think everyone expected to have to give him a bit of time but heâs been training really well in the gym, heâs worked really hard. You could see on the pitch straight away he was ready.â Haaland broke the deadlock in a tight game against Everton with a ruthless finish when a rebound fell his way in the 70th minute. He then wrapped up the win after being played in by De Bruyne five minutes from time. They were his first goals since November having spent two months on the sidelines with a foot problem. Ake said: âHeâs so quick, heâs fast, heâs strong. Out of nothing he can score and in those spaces one versus one itâs very difficult to stop him.â Pep Guardiola  Manager Pep Guardiola feels De Bruyne and Haaland add an extra layer to a side that was already impressing him. He said: âThese guys have special qualities. They have ability in final third to create something that is not in the statistics, not in the books, in genius managers. To have them for 90 minutes or even 30 or 45 minutes, it is better. âThat is not going to undermine what all their mates have done. We have a team with huge personalities in difficult moments.

However, with La Blaugrana unable to build on that advantage before the break, Granada converted their one real chance of the first 45Â  minutes. Granada stepped up the tempo before the break, and the visitors got their reward, as Ricard Sanchez showed superb technique to smash home Facundo Pellistriâs near post cross.

199,Santos president confirms Neymar transfer plan,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Santos-president-confirms-Neymar-transfer-plan/3299051,11 Feb,"Brazilian side Santos are plotting a move to bring Neymar Jr back to the club in future.  Neymar shot to fame during his breakthrough at Santos, with 136 goals scored in 225 games, before joining Barcelona in 2013. The 32-year-old won three league titles, plus the Copa Libertadores, before opting to make the move to Europe. After joining Paris Saint-Germain in a world record transfer in 2017, Neymar failed to win another Champions League trophy, following his success at Barcelona in 2015. He opted to accepted a summer move to SaudiÂ  Pro League giants Al Hilal, but his time in the Middle East has been disrupted by two serious injuries.  A serious knee ligament tear in October meant surgery, and he will not feature again this season, as he rehabilitation continues in Riyadh. His current deal at Al Hilal runs until 2025, but Santos are monitoring his situation, and club president Marcelo Teixeira claimed talks are now open. âThe conversation (with Neymar) was very quick, but itâs always quick conversations that have good effect. âTo come back and play here, he needs to recover well from injury. He will continue his experience in Saudi Arabia and then come back here.â","âTo come back and play here, he needs to recover well from injury.

201,Champions League club-by-club profiles and key players as knockout stages arrive,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Champions-League-club-by-club-profiles-and-key-players-as-knockout-stages-arrive/3301279,13 Feb,"The Champions League is back for the knockout stages, with both Arsenal and Manchester City hopeful of progressing.  The Gunners are up against Porto in the Last 16, while reigning champions City take on Copenhagen. The ties for the first phase of the knockouts will take place over the next four weeks across two legs. The quarter-finals will then be held in April, before the semi-finals in June give us the two teams who will face off to win the trophy at Wembley Stadium. City will get the last 16 stage underway on Tuesday when they face Copenhagen in Denmark. The Gunners will then travel to Porto a week on Wednesday to get their own knockout campaign started. Here Mirror Football profiles all 16 clubs in the knockout stages and their key players. The Portuguese side are Arsenalâs next opponents and, without doubt, one of the rank outsiders in the last 16. Brazilian striker Evanilson has been in good form - eight goals and two assists in 15 league games - and scored a hat trick in the Champions League against Royal Antwerp. He has been on the radar of a few clubs as Porto is such a strong breeding ground. But, interestingly, Porto have been behind Benfica and Sporting Lisbon in the title race which tells its own story. Key man: Evanilson It has been a testing season for Dortmund as they are battling for Champions League football rather than the Bundesliga title. That is probably why they did a loan deal for Jason Sancho to give them a boost. Having said all that, Dortmund qualified from the Group of Death with Newcastle, Paris Saint Germain and AC Milan. They are battle hardened in Europe and will be a threat. Marco Reus is a terrific player - even now. Key man: Marco Reus They have taken the Dutch league by storm this year and have blown Ajax away in the title race. Take them lightly at your peril. They qualified for the knock-out stages behind Arsenal and put out Sevilla in the process. PSV are runaway leaders and in prolific striker Luuk de Jong they have a goal machine who is scoring for fun. Key man: Luuk de Jong What a return to Europeâs top table for Mikel Arteta âs men and they face Porto in what should be a winnable path into the quarter finals. After so many years at getting stuck at the last 16 stage, they can finally get to the quarters for the first time since 2009/10. Arteta has enjoyed the tactical battle of the Champions League and Gabriel Jesus - if he can stay fit - has been prolific in this competition. Key man: Gabriel Jesus The Germans remain Champions League novices - and need a minor miracle to overcome Rea Madrid in the last 16 to keep their European dream alive. But Leipzig have been known to punch above their weight before, and made it all the way to the last four of the competition in 2020, before losing out to PSG. Marco Rose's side, who finished runners-up in their group to Manchester City, know they have nothing to lose in the knockout stages and can play without pressure. Key Player: Lois Openda The Spanish giants remain the kings of Europe, having won the competition a record 14 times. And it would take a brave person to bet against them doing it again this season. Cruised through their group and are feeding off the inspirational impact Englishman Jude Bellingham has made since arriving at the Bernabeu last summer. Carlo Ancelotti's men will take some stopping - and winning this trophy is all the club is ever measured by. Key Player: Vinicius Jnr Simone Inzaghi led Inter to the final last season, only to fall short against Treble winners Manchester City. And the Nerazzurri are impressing on the European stage again this time round, reaching the knockout stages with two games to spare. Atletico Madrid will be a tough nut to crack in the last 16, but striker Lautaro Martinez is leading from the front as captain and is deadly in front of goal, while Marcus Thuram is also having a stand out season. This lot could be the dark horses. Key Player: Lautaro Martinez Harry Kane âs side face a battle for the Bundesliga with Xavi Alonsoâs Bayer Leverkusen. But on the European front, the German giants beat Manchester United home and away in the group stage to maintain their status as perennial contenders for the Champions League. Along with Real Madrid, Bayern are the biggest obstacle to Manchester City retaining the title. Kaneâs goals have provided a focal point while the January signing of Eric Dier has added more depth to the squad as they seek a first Champions League triumph since 2020. Key player: Harry Kane The likes of Joao Felix have gone, but Atletico remain a force in Europe. The team no-one wants to face. Living in the shadow of Real gives Diego Simeone's men a chip on their shoulders, which makes them hard to beat. Atletico have lost just five games all season, remain unbeaten at home and reached the knockout stages without losing a group game, while conceding only six goals in the process. And the experienced Simeone knows how to succeed in this competition, having led his side to the final in 2014 and then again in 2016. Key Player: Arthur Vermeeren A Champions League triumph is now the only realistic way for Xavi Hernandez to finish his final season in charge at the Camp Nou with silverware. The former midfielder announced his decision to quit last month after successive heavy defeats in the Copa del Rey and La Liga. The Catalan giants are in the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time in three years despite shedding high earners such as Sergio Busquets, Ousmane Dembele and Gerard Pique. They remain Â£1bn in debt and have the pressure of needing to beat Napoli and reach the quarter finals to break even this season. Key player: Robert Lewandowski The southern club have suffered a giant hangover since winning the scudetto for the first time since the days of Diego Maradona. Head coach Luciano Spalletti left in the summer and his replacement Rudi Garcia lasted 16 games. Former Watford boss Walter Mazzarri has now returned to Napoli with the task of lifting them up the table and back into European contention for next season. After selling Kim Mae-Jin last summer, the reigning Serie A champions also face a battle to keep stars Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Key player: Victor Osimhen Pep Guardiola's men are timing their season to perfection again and are on course to defend their Champions League title. Theyâve won ten in a row. Top scorer Erling Haaland is banging goals in again after injury. Kevin De Bruyne is back and fit enough to start games again and the pair were on the pitch with key defender John Stones for the first time at the weekend since the final last season. Pep says he is almost certain the treble is not possible again, but they should breeze through to the last 8 in Europe. Key man: Erling Haaland Maurizio Sarriâs third season in Rome is set to be his last with his side languishing in mid-table and angry fans calling for the ex-Chelsea coach to be sacked. So far he has been protected by embattled president Claudio Lottito. Sarri has to work with a very ordinary squad including former Premier League players Luis Alberto, Pedro, Felipe Anderson and on-loan Matteo Guendouzi. Ciro Immobile, now 33, has scored only once since November. Lazio came through a weak Champions League group where they beat Celtic home and away and lost at Feyenoord. Key player: Ciro Immobile Kylian Mbappe had a rest at the weekend, unused on the bench, as PSG beat Lille 1-0 to go 11 points clear in the French league. Heâll be â100 percentâ recovered from an ankle injury to play, Luis Enrique says, desperate to keep alive the French clubâs elusive quest to be European champions. Will Mbappe win more than a one sided league at PSG? A controversial 96th minute penalty claim against Newcastle saved the French side from an early exit in November, but they dug out the points they needed and are formidable at home. Key man: Kylian Mbappe Man Cityâs next opponents come with a health warning. They unexpectedly won through to the knockout stage from a fiesty group containing Man U, Bayern Munich and Galatasaray. Coach Jacob Neestrup is just 35 and on this progress will be on the radar of Premier League clubs. And thereâs an element of Manc rivalry to their squad. Oscar and Emil HÃ¸jlund, the younger brothers of Manchester Unitedâs Rasmus HÃ¸jlund, in his first-team squad. City should catch them cold. Denmark has a two month winter break and this is their first game of 2024. Key man: Rooney Bardghji This is their first Champions League campaign for a decade and the Basques have achieved their aim of getting out of the group stage. Imanol Alguacilâs side are unbeaten in Europe this season, but have not won in four games domestically. They boast 11 home grown players, and play with an intensity that could shock PSG who can look shaky when pressured. They tend to score early, press high, and will look to emulate Newcastleâs blueprint when they beat PSG 4-1. Key player: Martin Zubimendi",Key player: Martin Zubimendi
202,Arsenal midfielder Jorginho makes a SHOCK inclusion in his top-five PL players,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-midfielder-Jorginho-makes-a-SHOCK-inclusion-in-his-top-five-PL-players/3302252,18 hours ago,"Arsenal midfielder Jorginho has surprised fans with his selection of the top five players in the Premier League.  The Italian has been well accustomed to the goings on in the English top-flight, having signed for Chelsea from Napoli in 2018 before making the move across London to the Gunners last January. Despite not being a permanent fixture in Mikel Arteta's starting XI, the 32-year-old has shown that he still has plenty to offer with a starring role in the north Londoner's 3-1 win over title rivals Liverpool earlier this month. Jorginho gave his opinion on which players should be considered among the league's best, including a selection that raised more than a few eyes. The inclusions of Manchester City stars Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland were expected. The pair are crucial cogs in Pep Guardiola's dominant machine, with the Belgian returning from his long injury lay-off to devastating effect with an assist in each of his four league appearances.  Reds talisman Mohamed Salah also made the cut. The Egyptian is gearing up for a return to action having suffered a posterior muscle injury while at AFCON with the Pharaohs. Jorginho's Arsenal team-mate Bukayo Saka was the first contentious inclusion. The England international's form after returning from the winter break certainly warrants merit. The winger has scored four goals in his last three league games, including a brace in the 6-0 demolition of West Ham last weekend. However, none were anticipating Jorginho's fifth choice, a former colleague: Reece James. The Chelsea skipper has endured a torrid time with injuries and is currently sidelined with a persistent hamstring problem which has left his participation in the European Championship in doubt.   'Believe me,' Jorginho said before responding to a query on whether he is better than Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold. 'A bit different. 'But if should choose for my team, I'd chose Reece. I think he's more complete on everything. 'Trent has these passes and shots that are unbelievable so they are a bit different. But overall I chose Reece.'",'Trent has these passes and shots that are unbelievable so they are a bit different. But overall I chose Reece.'
203,"Atletico Madrid manager Simeone derisive â âThank you La Liga, thank you RFEFâ",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Atletico-Madrid-manager-Simeone-derisive-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98Thank-you-La-Liga-thank-you-RFEF%E2%80%99/3300800,12 Feb,"Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has once again come out to publicly criticise the Spanish football authorities, with neither the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) or La Liga have escaped his wrath.  Simeone was critical of the RFEF for not moving their Copa del Rey semi-final first leg from Wednesday to Thursday last week, claiming that it was not fair that Athletic Club played on the Friday and had more rest, while Atletico played on the Sunday. After their defeat to Sevilla on Sunday night, Simeone was upbeat about his players, seeing their disappointing away form as a result of poor finishing. Los Rojiblancos are a midtable side away from home, and have won just 6 of their 12 away games in La Liga. âI am proud of the footballers, they are doing an extraordinary job. At this moment there are no word to explain the situation of the effort they made in the two matches to be able to tie or win the match. I understand that football has these twists and turns, the goals will come when they have to arrive,â he told Cadena SER. Ahead of their Champions League Round of 16 first leg with Inter Milan, Simeone was again frustrated with the calendar. âInter play on Friday, we play on Saturday, but hey, donât worry, thanks to La Liga, thanks to the Federation, we are going to continue moving forward just the same.â Los Rojiblancos take on Las Palmas at home on Saturday afternoon in the early kick-off, giving the Italian side around 16 hours extra rest, ahead of their clash on the Tuesday. Undoubtedly the scheduling has become increasingly tough for all sides involved, and Simeone is far from the only one to make his feelings felt. Nevertheless, his league rivals will point out that Simeone receives more than double the resources of the vast majority of his competition with which to handle those demands.","Los Rojiblancos take on Las Palmas at home on Saturday afternoon in the early kick-off, giving the Italian side around 16 hours extra rest, ahead of their clash on the Tuesday.

204,Real Madrid edging towards offering veteran new contract,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Madrid-edging-towards-offering-veteran-new-contract/3300902,13 Feb,"Real Madrid have a number of veterans that will be out of contract at the end of the season, and with that a number of decisions to make ahead of the summer. However it looks like the majority will come back next year, including Lucas Vazquez.  The 32-year-old winger turned right-back is now one of the longest-serving players at the club. With the exception of a season with Espanyol, he has been at Valdebebas for the last 17 years, and according to Relevo, they are edging towards offering him another year. While they are tracking other right-back options, including Yan Couto and Juanlu, they are in no hurry to make a move for the position, and have other priorities this summer. Vazquez has not been without criticism during his time at the Santiago Bernabeu, but has generally held up well, and his excellent recent form is convincing Los Blancos that they should offer him a new deal. The report also says that he is happy in Madrid, although not quite having the game time he would like, but also has a decision to make. It seems more likely than not that Vazquez will elect to stay â being over the age of 30, Real Madrid will only offer him a one-year deal at any rate. If they do not feel that there is a standout right-back they need to sign immediately then it makes sense. At some point in the near future they will no doubt be looking for a long-term replacement to Dani Carvajal too though.","It seems more likely than not that Vazquez will elect to stay â being over the age of 30, Real Madrid will only offer him a one-year deal at any rate.

The Croatian has fallen out of the team, and 12 years after arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu, his final months there appear to be coming into view.  The 38-year-old was a starter right up until the end of last season, but this year, his role has been dramatically dropped. Relevo say that his benching against RB Leipzig in the Champions League was the final straw, and he is moving towards an exit. Modric has now started just 15 of their 36 games this season, and while he has not been public about it, as he was at the start of the season, the frustration within for the lack of minutes is growing. At Valdebebas, they are already thinking out how to prepare his departure. They would prefer to take the bitterness out of the end, and are looking for emotional and special ways to pay truyte to legendary Modric. One of their options, seemingly is announcing his exit before the end of the season, and a la Andres Iniesta, have the stadiums and the fans pay homage to him every weekend. Whether that would happen is not clear â part of the reason Iniesta received so much adulation was not just becuase he was a brilliant player, but also as the scored the World Cup winner for Spain. His contribution was the most iconic in Spanish football history.","Whether that would happen is not clear â part of the reason Iniesta received so much adulation was not just becuase he was a brilliant player, but also as the scored the World Cup winner for Spain.

Beale watched on from the sidelines on Saturday afternoon as the Black Cats secured a 3-1 win over Plymouth Argyle to maintain their Play-Off push. However, the best moment for the Sunderland boss came when home supporters paid tribute to his young niece, who has had a relapse in her battle with leukaemia. In the fourth minute of the clash at the Stadium of Light, large sections of home supporters performed a minute-long ovation for Beale's niece. In a video posted onto the X, formerly known as Twitter, Beale was overcome with emotion and turned round to applaud the home fans.  Then speaking to club media afterwards, Beale spoke on the incident: 'My little niece, Poppy, has been going through it for a long, long time. 'She actually rung the bell on New Years [2022]. But then it's come back. She had a bone marrow transplant and we got some horrible news on Wednesday evening. 'Difficult to take but the fans today... that's incredible. It was an emotional moment for me so I just want to say thank you to everybody'. Later, in his post-match press conference, Beale had to momentarily pause after being overcome with emotion and said: 'It is hard to speak about it, thanks to everyone.' On Saturday afternoon, Beale also took to Instagram to share an update with his followers: 'F*** cancer - my niece Poppy is 4yrs old. 'From 18 months old she has been fighting leukemia, she has rang the bell, she has gone through a bone marrow match and transplant. 'This horrible disease has returned once again. Life is so harsh on a little girl and family that deserve so much more. We love you Pops â¤ï¸ you will beat this once again xx'.   Sunderland cruised to victory on the day thanks to goals from Pierre Ekwah, Jack Clarke and Jobe Bellingham after Ryan Hardie gave the visitors the lead. Bellingham's goal was the pick of the bunch as he danced through the Plymouth defence before unleashing a strike into the top corner. The Black Cats now sit sixth in the Championship table as they look to secure a place in the Play-Offs come the end of the season. Meanwhile, Plymouth are 15th in the table having fallen to consecutive league defeats.","Meanwhile, Plymouth are 15th in the table having fallen to consecutive league defeats."

210,UEFA reveal Man United's Â£1.2bn squad is the most expensive EVER assembled,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/UEFA-reveal-Man-Uniteds-%C2%A31.2bn-squad-is-the-most-expensive-EVER-assembled/3302120,1 day ago,"A UEFA report has revealed that Manchester United had the most expensive squad ever assembled at the end of the 2023 financial year.  The report looked at the figures from top-tier clubs across Europe and found the Red Devils' players cost a staggering Â£1.21bn in transfer fees in total. These numbers included the Â£80m they spent on defender Harry Maguire in 2019, Â£73m they splashed out on Jadon Sancho two years later and Â£60m they paid for Casemiro in 2022. Maguire has recently regained his place in United's starting XI, but Sancho is now on loan at Borussia Dortmund after falling out with Erik ten Hag and Casemiro has battled with injuries this term and turns 32 later this month. The transfers made last summer were not part of UEFA's data collection.   The Red Devils also spent big ahead of this season, bringing in Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Andre Onana for combined fees in excess of Â£175m. Hojlund has started to repay the faith the club have shown in him, scoring five goals in his last five outings, but Mount has spent most of the season on the treatment table after multiple injury setbacks, while Onana has endured an indifferent start after making a number of errors in United's disastrous Champions League campaign. Despite having the most-expensively assembled squad in the world, United still only finished third in the Premier League last term, 14 points behind champions Manchester City. This season has gone even worse for them, as they currently sit sixth in the table, and are in real danger of missing out on Champions League football. Three other clubs - City, Chelsea and Real Madrid - also had squads that cost over â¬1bn at the end of the most recent financial year. City take second place on the list with their squad costing â¬1.286bn (Â£1.1bn), followed by Chelsea â¬1.084bn (Â£927m) and Madrid â¬1.031bn (Â£882m). City's big-spending paid off as they completed a historic Treble last season, but the same cannot be said for Chelsea.    The Blues have spent over Â£1bn since Todd Boehly arrived at the club just under two years ago, but they could only finish 12th in 2022-23, and they are stuck in mid-table again this year under Mauricio Pochettino. Chelsea's transfers from last January and summer 2023 were also not included, when they twice broke their record transfer fee by signing Enzo Fernandez and then Moises Caicedo for Â£107m and Â£115m, respectively. The top three spots on UEFA's list are all taken by English clubs, and six other Premier League teams also feature inside the top 20 when it comes to transfer costs. Liverpool â¬905m (Â£774m) and Arsenal â¬890m (Â£761m) are sixth and seventh, respectively, with Tottenham ninth, Newcastle 12th, Aston Villa 15th and West Ham 17th. Newcastle have a more expensive squad than Bayern Munich in 13th, according to UEFA's figures. This does not take into account the Â£100m that the German giants paid Tottenham for Harry Kane in August, though. UEFA's report also highlighted the dominance the Premier League has when it comes to revenues. The total revenue of the 20 Premier League clubs was â¬6.5bn (Â£5.7bn), which was almost equal to the next two league combined, with LaLiga and the Bundesliga both generating â¬3.3bn (Â£2.9bn).   Nine of the top 20 revenues were generated by English clubs, including Brighton who had an income of â¬264m (Â£226m). Real Madrid led the way on the revenue front with â¬841m (Â£719m), followed by City (Â£715m), Barcelona (Â£697m) and PSG (Â£690m). PSG were also the most expensive team to watch, with the average matchday fan spending â¬140 (Â£120) on tickets and hospitality. Juventus and Tottenham were the only other clubs to have average matchday prices over â¬100 (Â£86).",Juventus and Tottenham were the only other clubs to have average matchday prices over â¬100 (Â£86).
211,Muller admits that he's 'p****d off' in explosive interview following defeat,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Muller-admits-that-hes-p****d-off-in-explosive-interview-following-defeat/3299198,11 Feb,"Thomas Muller has admitted that he is 'p**sed off' following Bayern Munich's 3-0 defeat away to Bayer Leverkusen.  The loss, which was inflicted courtesy of goals from Josip Stanisic, Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong, leaves Bayern Munich five points adrift of their opponents in the Bundesliga title race. Muller has been present for Bayern's eleven successive title triumphs but they are in danger of missing out this season. The 34-year-old admitted that there needs to be more 'energy and freedom' in his team's game. In an explosive interview, Muller told Sky Sports Germany: 'There are of course some symptoms on the pitch. To be honest, I'm p**sed off.  'To quote Oliver Kahn: What I miss from us players are the balls in the game. We are showing significantly better approaches in training. It's okay to feel pressure, but there needs to be energy and freedom. That's missing in our game.' Muller added that rather than pinning the blame for the defeat on coach Thomas Tuchel, the Bayern players also need to take respsonsibility. He said: 'Sometimes we have to speak about us players. It's not just about the coach. 'We have many international players at the highest level, we need to step up our game.' Muller featured as a substitute against Bayer Leverkusen as he entered the fray in the 60th minute. Tuchel was livid that Stanisic, who found the net, was able to play against his parent club Bayern. Bayern face Lazio away in the Champions League in midweek and they will be determined to bounce back when they return to league action with an away game against Bochum. ",

213,Xabi Alonso celebrates with entire coaching staff following victory over Bayern,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Xabi-Alonso-celebrates-with-entire-coaching-staff-following-victory-over-Bayern/3299103,11 Feb,"Bayer Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso appeared to take a leaf out of Jurgen Klopp's book by celebrating with his entire coaching staff after beating Bayern Munich.  Leverkusen won 3-0 at home to Bayern and are now five points clear of their opponents at the top of the Bundesliga. Former Liverpool midfielder Alonso has been heavily linked with the Anfield job after Jurgen Klopp announced that he will leave the club at the end of the season. Klopp has often given his coaching staff credit following important victories and Alonso did likewise after Bayer's win. Alonso's side prevailed courtesy of goals from Josip Stanisic, Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong.  After the game Alonso made sure that his coaching staff joined him in celebrating with the club's fans. Alonso has received much praise for the work that he has done since being appointed as Bayer Leverkusen boss in October 2022. If he was to win the Bundesliga title this season - ending Bayern's dominance of having won the league eleven times in a row - Alonso's stock would rise even higher. As a player Alonso was at Liverpool between 2004 and 2009. He won the Champions League and the FA Cup during his time at the club. One Liverpool fan suggested that it's inevitable Alonso will return to the club. They wrote: 'Gesture like this make me think that he knows we are all watching him like heâs being interviewed already.' Another added: 'Bring this man to Liverpool immediately'. One fan suggested that Alonso's appointment is: 'Signed, sealed, delivered.' Another claimed that Alonso is the 'ideal successor' to Klopp at Liverpool. They wrote: 'What a manager, what a man. As a leader there are many resemblances to Klopp. This *is* the ideal Klopp successor at Liverpool.' In addition, another fan wrote: 'Bring him home is right! Be mad not to sign Xabi up heâs the right man for the job!'.      ",

Sixteen sides have progressed to the finals of the 2024 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup which gets underway in Dubai on 15 February and runs through to the final game on the 25th. Dubaiâs Design District will be the setting for the action with beach soccer infamous for serving up some eye-catching goals with venomous volleys, outrageous over-head kicks and spectacular strikes all part and parcel of the sport. Reigning champions Russia are absent from this yearâs competition due to the ongoing indefinite FIFA sporting ban linked to the nationâs invasion of Ukraine which sees five-time champions Brazil take on the mantle as tournament favourites with the SeleÃ§ao absent from the final for a decade as other nations such as Tahiti, Senegal, Japan and El Salvador embrace the sport and see their national teams now able to compete at elite levels. The sixteen competing sides are split into four groups of four teams with the top two per group advancing to the quarter-final stage. Games are divided into three 12-minute periods, with a three-minute break between each period and the match stopwatch is paused in the event of a goal, a foul or an injury. A match can only be won or lost and never ends in a draw. If the scores are tied at the end of the game, the rules stipulate that a three-minute period of extra time must be played. If there is still no winner after this, the match must be decided by penalty kicks with all five players per team taking a kick. The playing sandy area must be between 35 and 37 metres long and between 26  and 28 metres wide, and marked with lines 10 centimetres wide. The goals are 2.2 metres high and 5.5 metres wide with the ball being a little lighter tran a traditional match ball weight between 400 and 440 grams.

217,Ladyman: Liverpool NEED to keep their two-point cushion over Man City,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ladyman-Liverpool-NEED-to-keep-their-two-point-cushion-over-Man-City/3302792,9 hours ago,"Liverpool must cling on to their two-point lead by the time they play Manchester City, Ian Ladyman has argued - or risk being crestfallen once again come the season's close.  Jurgen Klopp's men face Brentford, Luton, and Nottingham Forest in their league before their Anfield assignment against City on March 10. They hold a slender two-point advantage over City and Arsenal but Pep Guardiola's side are the ones everybody fears. The Treble-winners have hit their mid-season stride again, winning 11 games on the bounce dating back to the Club World Cup. The last time they lost a game was December 6, a 1-0 loss at Aston Villa. 'Liverpool have got the next three games in the league are Brentford, Luton, Forest and that to me feels like they're going to have to win those three simply because after that little run comes their crunch game with Man City at Anfield and then the Merseyside Derby away at Goodison Park,' Ladyman told Mail Sport's football podcast It's All Kicking Off.  'They can't afford any separation between themselves and City in the next month, that's what I'm getting at.' Chris Sutton agreed, adding that Liverpool have got to be clinical to stay in front of a relentless City, who have won the last three Premier League titles. He said: 'Look, we all know, right, that Liverpool have to be ruthless. That goes without saying. Nobody I've met in the last week or two has changed their mind about Manchester City, because you just feel it and you look at their bench every week and the ability to change things. 'We shouldn't be judging Liverpool just based on that one Arsenal game. They actually recovered okay against Burnley, saw the pictures of Mo Salah back in full training. I mean, that's absolutely enormous. 'So they've got a lot to look forward to. The teams they've got coming up, you mentioned Brentford, who they've conceded a few goals against in recent times, but Jurgen Klopp knows they have to be absolutely ruthless, but I wouldn't be ruling Liverpool out because of their firepower.' Ladyman believes Liverpool could face a situation where they reach the end of the season and finish second even if they only lose a handful of games, such are the tight margins at the top of the Premier League. Liverpool have twice finished just a point behind City, scoring 97 points in 2018-19 and 92 points in 2021-22. Ladyman added: 'I just think that we're in this typical Man City cycle again. In my opinion, City are the best team, right? But that doesn't mean they win the league, because good teams can have bad runs. But I see them, they're 11 unbeaten now, 11 wins on the spin, if you go all the way back to the start of the club World Cup, and this is what they do.    'And I can just imagine if Liverpool aren't careful they're going to get to the end of May when the season ends and they're going to look back and they'll have lost like three games all season, but somehow haven't won the league because it's happened to them before. 'And they are in this dreadfully difficult position of knowing that they've pretty much got to win everything and they've certainly got to win that game against Manchester City at Anfield next month. And it would be ideal for them to get there still with this two-point cushion. That's what I'm trying to get at, I think. And they've got three games. 'Well, that's how I started: Brentford, Luton, Forest. They've got to win those three games.'","'Well, that's how I started: Brentford, Luton, Forest. They've got to win those three games.'"
218,Gavi is a target for PSG this summer,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Gavi-is-a-target-for-PSG-this-summer/3302562,18 hours ago,"FC Barcelona midfielder Gavi (19) has emerged as a target for Paris Saint-Germain this summer, report Peter Rutzler and Pol Ballus of The Athletic.  Whilst the Blaugrana have no desire to sell the talented Spanish youngster and La Masia graduate, the clubâs well documented financial problems may force the Catalan clubâs hierarchy into a rethink. The player is projected to be out of action until the summer having suffered a cruciate ligament injury back in November. Having already made 111 appearances for Xaviâs ailing Barcelona side, as well as 27 caps for the Spanish national team, Gavi is thought to be part of PSG coach Luis Enriqueâs plan to re-shape the squad following the expected departure of Kylian MbappÃ© this coming summer. Gavi is contracted to Barcelona until the end of the 2025/2026 and his situation, as well as his huge potential, would therefore command a sizeable fee, one that only PSG and a handful of others could hope to afford. It is as yet unclear as to the playerâs thoughts on the move, but it may be one that could suit all parties, for the right price. GFFN | Jack McArdle",GFFN | Jack McArdle
219,Liverpool fans name the coach they most want to succeed Jurgen Klopp in a survey,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Liverpool-fans-name-the-coach-they-most-want-to-succeed-Jurgen-Klopp-in-a-survey/3302249,18 hours ago,"Xabi Alonso is the overwhelming favourite among Liverpool supporters to succeed Jurgen Klopp as manager, a survey has found.  Klopp will call time on nine successful years in charge at Anfield at the end of the season after the German admitted he was feeling exhausted. Attention has already turned to his successor and the bookmakers' favourite also appears to be the fan first-choice. The Sky Bet Fan Hope survey, conducted by YouGov, found 63 per cent of Liverpool fans asked want Bayer Leverkusen coach Alonso to be the club's next manager. Former Reds midfielder Alonso, 42, is enjoying an outstanding campaign with Leverkusen, who crushed their Bundesliga title rivals Bayern Munich 3-0 last Saturday to move five points clear at the top.    Leverkusen are also still in both the German Cup and the UEFA Europa League ahead of what promises to be an exciting end to the season. Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard ranked second among fans surveyed but his total of 18 per cent was a long way shy of his former team-mate Alonso. Klopp's assistant Pep Lijnders received eight per cent, Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi four per cent and Ruben Amorim, Julian Nagelsmann and Thomas Frank two per cent apiece. In a sign of the pressure Alonso or whoever replaces Klopp will find themselves under, 56 per cent of Liverpool fans expect a Premier League title challenge in their first season at the helm. Meanwhile, 73 per cent of fans expect Klopp to sign off by wining at least two trophies this season, while an optimistic six per cent think Liverpool will scoop a Quadruple of Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League. The arrival of a new manager could see squad upheaval in the summer but the survey revealed Mohamed Salah is the one man fans don't want to see depart.   55 per cent of the Liverpool fans asked said they are most afraid of the Egyptian star leaving, a figure well ahead of goalkeeper Alisson Becker on 24 per cent and defender Virgil van Dijk on 21 per cent. Liverpool, who are currently two points ahead of Manchester City at the Premier League summit, return to action at Brentford on Saturday lunchtime. They host Luton Town next Wednesday before taking on Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on February 25.",They host Luton Town next Wednesday before taking on Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on February 25.
220,Deco statements that have Barca fans calling for his sacking and the fallout,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Deco-statements-that-have-Barca-fans-calling-for-his-sacking-and-the-fallout/3300758,12 Feb,"Barcelona Sporting Director Deco was present as the Blaugrana threw away more points at home to Granada on Sunday night, ending in a thrilling 3-3 draw which once again exposed their inability to defend. However by the end of the night, he was the story.  That is due to comments he has made in Portugal to Nascer do Sol, opining on the current affairs of the Blaugrana. During an interview, he claimed that Barcelona needed to move away from the idea of play that has made them so successful until now. âThe new direction is essential and the president agrees with me on this. A profound change is needed. There is a method that is exhausted,â he said, as carried by Sport. âWe have to discover someone who will break with the past once and for all and move towards a new paradigm.â He also went on to pronounce that the job he is currently hiring for is not that attractive for potential managers. âWe have a serious financial problem on our hands and that was one of the reasons why they hired me. We do not have money for the investments that other million-dollar clubs make and that discourages any coach. At this moment we cannot provide these means.â His comments, essentially claiming Barcelona should leave behind the ideas upon which their three greatest eras were built upon, have naturally brought with them no shortage of fury from Cules. Deco has since told Catalunya Radio that his words were misunderstood, and when he refers to the model and the paradigm, he claims was related to the financial crisis at the club and how they recruit. In addition, Nascer do Sol have published an editorâs note, claiming full responsibility for the âmisunderstandingâ. Recent reports from El Desmarque claim that Deco will now put out a message via the clubâs official channels to clarify his statements too. Itâs certainly a strange story, given Portuguese is Decoâs native tongue, and the interview was conducted in Portuguese. His words have been public for several days, but having only recently been picked up by the Catalan media, it appears only now the retractions have been made. It would be common practice for Deco or Barcelona to be sent the interview before or as it is being published, and it is curious that this either did not happen, or the misunderstanding was not flagged previously.","Itâs certainly a strange story, given Portuguese is Decoâs native tongue, and the interview was conducted in Portuguese.

221,The earliest Xavi could be sacked from the Barcelona job,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/The-earliest-Xavi-could-be-sacked-from-the-Barcelona-job/3300887,12 Feb,"A defeat in the first leg of the Champions League could prove to be fatal for the Blaugrana coach. Rafa MÃ¡rquez is lined up as a possible emergency solution.  The situation at Can BarÃ§a can be best be described as critical in every sense of the word. Sundayâs 3-3 draw against Granada only confirmed the chronicle of a death foretold. The vaunted reaction after the announcement of Xaviâs delayed resignation has barely lasted a week. This weekendâs setback has revealed all the ills of this team. So much so that right now, as AS has learned, no one in the club is capable of guaranteeing that the 44-year-old coach will still be in the job by the end of the season. All eyes are focused on the Champions League tie against Napoli in a weekâs time. The result of that match could mark Xaviâs short-term future. A defeat could precipitate the immediate departure of the current coach, with Rafa MÃ¡rquez the leading candidate to be ushered in to occupy the bench until the end of the season. President Joan Laporta, who continues to protect Xavi within the club, is beginning to show clear signs of exhaustion in the project, as was seen in the MontjuÃ¯c box last night, throwing a tray of canapÃ©s after the team practically spoiled any hopes of clinching LaLiga title. His advisors and trusted people have been pressuring him for some time to make a decision regarding the coach, as a first step in search of a reaction to a season in which some still see the Champions League as the only salvation. Sports director, Deco, also seems to have turned his back on Xavi, especially after his latest statements to a Portuguese media, later denied and/or qualified, about the current model of Barcelona I was exhausted. As AS has learned, Xavi has made it very clear that if the team doesnât make it through the Champions League knockout round, he will not continue. The coach has always stressed that he will never be a problem at the club, so if he sees that the best solution is for him to leave early, he will do so without any problem. But right now, he is not reached the point of no return. He still believes that he can lift the team and salvage something from the season. Obviously, the objective in LaLiga is to catch up with Girona and finish at least second, thus guaranteeing not only the Super Cup but also participation in next yearâs Champions League. In Europe, the aim is to go as far as possible, reaching the quarter finals at the very least. What is certain is that whatever happens this Saturday in Vigo, Xavi will continue. It will be Naples who ends up passing the sentence. A defeat in San Paolo would bring forward the end of Xavi's project by a few months.","What is certain is that whatever happens this Saturday in Vigo, Xavi will continue.

The LaLiga side kept PSG largely at bay, with Mbappe and Ousmane Dembele failing to finish off two close chances in the first-half. It was the brilliance of the France World Cup winner, and his excellent reactions, that would help Luis Enrique's side take the lead in the 58th minute, with Mbappe stretching at the far post to knock in a Marquinhos' deflection from a free-kick. Bradley Barcola would follow up with a second goal later on in the second half, gliding around several defenders before dinking past Alex Remiro to seal the victory and score his first goal in the Champions League. Mail Sport brings you our player ratings from PSG's victory at the Parc Des Princes.  Was called into action on several occasions but ultimately a quiet evening for the Italian. Achraf Hakimi - 6.5 Stretched defenders down the right flank, perhaps not as creative in the first-half as he'd have liked. Marquinhos - 7 It was his flick on that set Mbappe up for the opened. Marshalled the defence well tonight. Danilo Pereira - 7 Looks a solid partner for Marquinhos at the back. Lucas Beraldo - 6.5 A solid Champions League debut for the 20-year-old. Looked composed on the ball and his positioning was excellent. Fabian Ruiz - 7 Produced a great assist for Barcola's goal. Looked creative through the middle. Warren Zaire-Emery - 6.5 Strong defensively. Perhaps could have offered more going forwards.    Grew into the game in the second half. Produced some great passes and was technically excellent. Ousmane Dembele - 5.5 Produced a great pass to initiate Barcola's goal. But lacked a clinical edge infront of goal, missing a big chance in the first half. Bradley Barcola - 7.5 Scored his first goal in the Champions League and took it very well. He glided past defenders to break into the box and wrapped up the move with a great finish. Kylian Mbappe - 8 Stepped up when PSG needed him despite missing a chance early in the first-half. The Frenchman showed his excellent reactions to arrive at the far post before anyone else. Marco Asensio 72' - 6 Looked bright when he came on but could have made it 3-0 with a thumping effort in the last five minutes of the match.   Lucas Hernandez 72' - 5 Struggled to control Takefusa Kubo after coming on. Randal Kolo Muani 83' - 5.5 Came on late and nearly got on the scoresheet. Showed great ability to evade the Real Sociedad defenders but struck his effort marginally wide. Luis Enrique - 7 Definitely not the first-half he'd have wanted but galvanised his team at half-time to seal the victory. He'll have plenty to think about before their return fixture in March. Real Sociedad: Remiro 6, Traore 6, Zubeldia 7, Le Normand 5, Galan 7, Mendez 7, Zubimendi 8, Merino 7, Kubo 8, Andre Silva 7, Barrenetxea 7.

The defender is the first Brazilian to captain the club. He told TNT Brazil: ""It is a source of great pride. A team with great tradition like Juventus has always been well represented for a long time by historic Italian players. After being vice-captain last year, this season I became captain of the team. This has to do with my experience in other leagues and countries, with my way of communicating with my teammates, with the referees and with the Juventus universe. ""The fact that the coach's decision was accepted so well, especially by my teammates of the team, fills me with pride. I am proud that even the Italian fans, who defend their flag and their culture, often greet me and thank me for always defending Juventus and its colours. I feel part of the club, of the city and of its traditions."" On 'popstar' footballers, he continued: ""Today footballers who are not 'popstars' sell little, have little media visibility. A player who goes out to dinner the week in which his team loses the match (which is obviously something you can do) becomes much more popular of a player than who goes to a charity event or who, for example, goes to help a community. ""My effort today is to try to influence the new generations of athletes and footballers. I can be a high level athlete, I can play with the best in the world, for the greatest national team in the world, have a successful career, earn a lot of money (because we are not hypocrites, we all want to earn money), but still lead a normal life. I don't need to go around showing off super cars and always being in the midst of social controversy. ""Of course no one is perfect, we all make mistakes and learn, which is what I have tried to do throughout my career.

224,"13 footballers who overcame adversity to make it to top: Haller, Salah, Messiâ¦",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/13-footballers-who-overcame-adversity-to-make-it-to-top-Haller-Salah-Messi%E2%80%A6/3301858,1 day ago,"Essentially only needing a ball to play it, the accessibility of football has seen it adopted globally by millions who didnât have the means for anything else.  As such, thousands came from humble upbringings to play the game professionally, while there are no shortage of top-level footballers who overcame real adversity to make it where they are. These are some of the most inspiring stories. âObviously the last 18 months have been challenging for me and my family. I now take everything step by step and try to enjoy every moment. I donât want to have any regrets,â the Borussia Dortmund striker told reporters ahead of Ivory Coastâs 2023 AFCON final against Nigeria. âGiven what has happened over the last months, itâs great today to be here in front of you and speak about the final. I want to enjoy it and hopefully tomorrow so will all the Ivorians. âBut I think it might take months or years to take it all in, what has happened over the last years.â Twelve months after returning from treatment for testicular cancer, Haller scored the match-winner as Ivory Coast came from behind to beat the Super Eagles 2-1 on home soil. A remarkable moment in a remarkable comeback. When Salah was 14 years old, he signed for El Mokawloon (Arab Contractors), a club that trained four and a half hours away from where he lived. For five days a week, Salah would leave the house at 9am to make the nine-hour round trip for a two-hour training session, eventually returning home at 10pm to do it all again the next day. Speaking to Liverpoolâs official website, he said: âIt wasnât just taking one bus â Iâd have to transfer buses three, four or even sometimes five times just to arrive at training and then back home again. âAs I said, it was a difficult time, but I was young and I wanted to be a footballer. I wanted to be a big name. I wanted to be something special. âI cannot promise you that it was clear to me what I would become and I was like, âI will be something specialâ. No, it was not like this. I was coming from nothing, a 14-year-old kid with a dream. I didnât know it would happen, I just wanted it to happen so badly.â Since moving to Merseyside, Salah has become a phenomenon, breaking all kinds of goalscoring records and winning everything there is to win with the Reds. Just before the 2014 World Cup, ESPN published a several-thousand-word character portrait of Suarez which reads like the ultimate epic rags-to-riches screenplay. Born in Salto, 500km north of Montevideo, he had an impoverished upbringing, especially after his family moved to the capital when he was seven. A young lover of football, at 14 he reportedly considered giving up on early ambitions of playing the game, having to be dragged to training. Instead, he swept the streets to earn a living for himself because his family couldnât for him. âEveryone in Uruguay knows what Suarez fought against, and rose above,â wrote Wright Thompson. âThatâs how he exists in the national consciousness, as someone who fights to win, no matter what, running to escape poverty and obscurity. âA man doesnât bite simply because he is crazy. He bites because he is clinging to a new life, terrified of being sucked back into the one he left behind.â A few short weeks later, Suarez would make national headlines after another biting incident, the third of his career, in which he sunk his teeth into Georgio Chielliniâs shoulder. After the incident, Suarez was banned for an unprecedented four months, one of the longest in football history. Heâs since taken anger management lessons and became one of Barcelonaâs greatest-ever strikers, developing a good relationship with Lionel Messi on and off the pitch. Winning the treble in his first season at the club, heâs since won another four La Liga titles with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid and is now enjoying a well-earned victory lap with his former Barcelona pals out in Miami. Born in 1966 in south-east Liberia, Weah grew up in one of the countryâs poorest areas, the Clara Town slum of Monrovia. But starting out playing for local amateur teams, his precocious talent was spotted by Cameroon coach Claude Le Roy who signed him for Tonnerre Yaounde. From there, up and coming young Monaco coach Arsene Wenger was alerted to him, flew out to Cameroon to see him and subsequently brought him over to Europe, where history was made: three-time African footballer of the year, a Ballon dâOr winner in 1995, with an honours list that includes league titles in France and Italy and a late-career FA Cup with Chelsea. Coming from humble beginnings to become a professional footballer is one thing, but being sworn into the highest office of your country is another entirely â after extensive years of humanitarian work and political campaigning, Weah became the President of Liberia in January 2018. One of Weahâs early acts as president was to appoint his former coaches Arsene Wenger and Claude Le Roy by the insignia of Knight Grand Commander of Humane Order of African Redemption. Mosesâ parents were both killed in religious clashes when he was just 11 years old. From there, he sought asylum in England after his family in Nigeria managed to save enough money for him to move away. Adopted by foster parents in South Norwood, he stood out in the local youth leagues, enough to sign a schoolboy contract with Crystal Palace. He since moved to Wigan and then Chelsea, where he won the FA Cup, Premier League and Europa League. Moses also become a national hero in Nigeria, having won the African Cup Of Nations with them in 2013. Looking back on about his upbringing in a 2017 interview with BBC Sport, he said: âWhen I started going to school, I started getting used to things, like the language. After that, I started adapting to school, friends and everything. âIt was really difficult to start with, but I survived.â Wright is not unique in that he came from a working-class background, and heâs far from the only player that worked his way from non-league to the very top of the game. But he did come through a particularly turbulent adolescence, leaving home at 14 and becoming a labourer, before motoring offences saw him spend a week in prison when he was 18. Rejected at trials, the gifted centre-forward looked to settle for football as a hobby when he took to Sunday league and eventually amateur side Greenwich Borough. It was there he was spotted by a Crystal Palace scout and history was made. After impressing at Palace, he spent seven unforgettable seasons at Arsenal during the 90s. 185 goals, two FA Cups, a League Cup, the Cup Winners Cup and a Premier League title. Developing his talents in 1980s South Africa, Radebe absolutely tore it up as one of the finest teenage talents in the country, playing in midfield and even in goal before establishing himself as the commanding centre-half he forged a reputation as. A natural move to giants of South African football Kaizer Chief followed, and everything looked set for him to make a move to Europe when, suddenly, he was hit by a bullet. âIt was like my back was on fire. I was in a car with my younger brother and I remember my leg going numb and then the car stalled,â said Radebe in an interview with Sky Sports. âI reached back and I realised there was blood so I changed seats and my brother rushed me off to the hospital. I realised I was lucky that the bullet didnât go into any vital organs, it just went through flesh.â Sidelined after the shooting, he reportedly missed a match in which a Besiktas scouts were due to watch him, and fate conspired to see him move to Leeds, where he spent 11 years to see out the rest of his career. But the highlight came with his country, winning South Africaâs first Cup Of Nations, a year after the rugby teamâs symbolic post-apartheid World Cup win. The tales of the diminutive Argentinianâs breathtaking ability, even at the earliest stages of his development, are well-worn and established in his legend now. But he might never have made it as a senior professional if heâd never been able to overcome his stunted growth problems as a child. The growth hormone disorder, sometimes known as idiopathic short stature, did not just affect Messiâs height and could have had wider effects on his immunity and pituitary gland functions. Part of his original agreement to join Barcelona, famously signed on a napkin, was predicated upon the club stumping up the reported $900 monthly expense, that neither his family nor clubs in Argentina could afford for a teenage talent, prodigy or no prodigy. Itâs probably fair to say that Barcelona got value for money with that one. Thereâs not enough room on the page to list his individual records or honours won. Needless to say, heâs not bad. Dying of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 49, the Brazilian genius never outran his demons or escaped the addiction that defined his early life, growing up in poverty in a household with an alcoholic father. On top of that, he had several birth defects that affected his spine and legs, which he would not prevail over but would go on to characterise a unique physical playing style. âHe wasnât a player who would run 80 meters,â Brazil-based football journalist Tim Vickery describes. âHe would run a little bit. Stop. Run a little bit. Stop. Run a little bit. Stop. âVery, very often, they doubled up or even tripled up to mark him. So you have a line of people, but they never all go in at the same time. Itâs a little bit like watching a Bruce Lee film where heâs able to fight off one and then dribble âround the next.â His life was one of tragedy, but it didnât stop him becoming a genius on the pitch and one of the most revered, beloved figures in Brazilian football history. He scored a hat-trick, aged 19, on his debut for Botafogo and that would set the tone for a career that saw back-to-back World Cups and many more domestic trophies. Born into the war-torn Balkans, his grandfather was shot dead in the conflict when Modric was just six years old. His family fled the war in 1991, seeking refuge in different hotels in the historic city of Zadar. Like many others, Modric was obsessed with football and used to practice in the car park of the hotel he spent a portion of his upbringing. Heâs since become one of the defining figures of Real Madridâs five-time Champions League winning era, a World Cup finalist with Croatia, and the man who put an end to the Messi & Ronaldo duopoly on the Balon dâOr has some story behind him. The former Ajax and Nigeria legend nearly missed a huge chunk of his career that would have denied him the two Premier League titles and three FA Cups he won in England. When he was at Inter Milan in 1996, a routine medical check-up detected a serious heart defect that could have put an end to a career with at least a decade of great potential still in it. But open heart surgery potentially saved his life and allowed him to carry on playing football. Since retiring, heâs set up the Kanu Heart Foundation, which has made it possible for hundreds of people to have similar corrective, life-saving operations. Okay, known for being one of Manchester Unitedâs weirdest and most disastrous signings, Bebe is nowhere near at the level of some of the legendary figures on this list. But the fact he ever arrived at Old Trafford is something of a minor miracle, having grown up in an orphanage and once participated in a homeless world cup. âI had eight years in an orphanage. There, I did not like football,â the Portuguese later reminisced. âBut my friends always wanted to play and I had no choice but to join in. âAt first I thought it was a joke [when he was told of Unitedâs interest], but then I saw it was true and understood that it was a unique opportunity.â It didnât work out for Bebe in Manchester, but heâs since forged a perfectly respectable career in football, and is something of a cult hero at Rayo Vallecano. One of Arsenalâs invincible legends overcame the odds to even be born. His politician father, Valentin Bisan-Etame, was an outspoken critic of Equatorial Guineaâs murderous dictator, Francisco Macias. His resistance to the despotic regime saw him imprisoned and sentenced to death before he escaped and crossed the border to Cameroon, alongside his wife who was pregnant with Lauren. Growing up in Cameroon and later moving to Seville, Lauren didnât have it easy in the deprived neighbourhood of Montequinto, alongside his 14 brothers. âFrom the first to the 10th we were OK, but from then until the end of the month you had to look after yourself,â he told The Independent in a 2005 interview. âI did not very good things. I was in trouble with the police many times. I got away from that just at the right moment.â ",
225,Rangnick in the frame to be next Barcelona boss,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Rangnick-in-the-frame-to-be-next-Barcelona-boss/3301457,2 days ago,"Former Manchester United interim boss Ralf Rangnick has emerged as a surprise contender to succeed Xavi Hernandez at Barcelona next season.  The 65-year-old is revered in his native Germany but endured a disappointing stint at Old Trafford after agreeing to step in following the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021. The former RB Leipzig coach has been in charge of the Austria national team since leaving United and guided them to qualification for this summer's European Championship. Barcelona president Joan Laporta is reportedly a big fan of Rangnick and 'really likes' him as an option to replace Xavi, according to Spanish outlet Sport. Despite his underwhelming stint in the Premier League, Rangnick's reputation as a developer of top young talent has endured.   While Laporta is a fan of Rangnick, Barcelona have drawn up a star-studded shortlist of candidates to succeed coach Xavi Hernandez with Mikel Arteta, Xabi Alonso and Roberto De Zerbi reportedly among the contenders. Xavi announced on January 27 that he will depart the club at the end of the season, having taken over in November 2021. Attention has quickly turned to his replacement with Mundo Deportivo mentioning a number of names in the frame. Arsenal boss Arteta, 41, came through at Barcelona's academy and his attacking style would be attractive to the Nou Camp club. However, as Mundo say, Arteta is contracted to Arsenal until 2025, is enjoying plenty of success there and last month described links to Barca as 'totally fake news'. Responding to reports, Arteta said: 'I don't know where it is coming from and it is totally untrue. I am really upset about it. I could not believe it. It has no source. 'It has got nothing and I think we have to be very cautious when you talk about personal things.' Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Enrique, 53, is touted for a potential return, having coached the club between 2014 and 2017. This successful spell included Barcelona's 2015 Champions League success - part of a Treble - and he too favours the classic Barca style of playing. But Mundo qualify this by pointing out he, too, has a contract at his current club until next year and whether Barcelona's tight financial situation could prove off-putting. The Brighton boss De Zerbi has impressed in the Premier League, they say, but has no experience of leading a big club with elite-level players.   They say De Zerbi's passing style would go down well, as would the endorsements ex-Barca favourite Pep Guardiola has given him in the past. Another interesting name mentioned is Bayer Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso, who is the favourite to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. The Spaniard has excelled in Germany, with Leverkusen surprise Bundesliga title contenders as they tussle with Bayern Munich at the top. Mundo are impressed by his 'intense, dynamic and vertical game' there but admit his links with Real Madrid, where he spent five years, and Liverpool's interest would scupper Barca.","Mundo are impressed by his 'intense, dynamic and vertical game' there but admit his links with Real Madrid, where he spent five years, and Liverpool's interest would scupper Barca."

227,Real Madrid still open to move for right-back this summer â Fabrizio Romano,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Madrid-still-open-to-move-for-right-back-this-summer-%E2%80%93-Fabrizio-Romano/3301297,13 Feb,"Real Madrid have outlined their priorities for this summer, which run through Kylian Mbappe and Alphonso Davies, but there are one or two loose ends to be tied up. Los Blancos are still uncertain on whether veterans Toni Kroos and Luka Modric will be there next season, and will have to make calls on Nacho Fernandez and Lucas Vazquez.  The recent current has been pointing towards three of the four renewing, with Modric being the only one that could depart. The Croatian maestro has seen his role reduced this season, and Fabrizio Romano has told Caught Offside that the club will not try to influence his decision. âLuka Modric and Toni Kroos are two of the best players in the world and they have earned the right to decide what they want to do in terms of staying at Real Madrid or not,â he explained on The Daily Briefing. âCarlo Ancelotti has said that he believes that players should retire when theyâre still at the top, but itâs completely up to Kroos and Modric now â Real Madrid are just waiting on their decision.â The most recent development has been that Real Madrid are edging towards another extension for Lucas Vazquez at right-back, but Romano claims they will still make a move if they see a deal they like. âAside from Kroos and Modric, there is the potential left-back situation with Alphonso Davies as discussed, and letâs see if a new right-back could also be a topic too, based on opportunities.â In recent months Girona right-back Yan Couto, who has a year left on his deal with parent club Manchester City, and Sevilla youngster Juanlu Sanchez have been linked as potential Vazquez replacements, and long-term options to succeed Dani Carvajal. Vazquez has shown in recent weeks that he continues to hold the nerve for big games.","In recent months Girona right-back Yan Couto, who has a year left on his deal with parent club Manchester City, and Sevilla youngster Juanlu Sanchez have been linked as potential Vazquez replacements, and long-term options to succeed Dani Carvajal.

228,Barca has no plans to sell the 23-year-old following an impressive resurgence,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barca-has-no-plans-to-sell-the-23-year-old-following-an-impressive-resurgence/3299301,11 Feb,"Last summer, it looked highly likely that Ferran Torres would be one of the players to exit Barcelona. The former Manchester City and Valencia forward had struggled to establish himself under head coach Xavi Hernandez, which had led to increased speculation over his future, especially with the clubâs ongoing financial woes.  In the end, Torres stayed after convincing Xavi during pre-season. Since then, he has arguably been Barcelonaâs best forward, scoring 11 goals across all competitions despite having not regularly played as a starter. Torres has not only convinced Xavi, but also the Barcelona hierarchy, who have no plans to sell the 23-year-old this summer, as reported by MD. He is highly valued for how he makes the most of his opportunities, while his versatility to play across the entire front three attacking positions is also greatly appreciated. With the possibility of Joao Felix and Raphinha not being at Barcelona next season, it is even more crucial that Torres continues his excellent form into the 2024-25 campaign, where he looks set to continue being an important player for the Catalan giants.","With the possibility of Joao Felix and Raphinha not being at Barcelona next season, it is even more crucial that Torres continues his excellent form into the 2024-25 campaign, where he looks set to continue being an important player for the Catalan giants."
229,Bukayo Saka sends title message to Arsenal's rivals Liverpool and Man City,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Bukayo-Saka-sends-title-message-to-Arsenals-rivals-Liverpool-and-Man-City/3300816,12 Feb,"Bukayo Saka believes Arsenal have made a ""statement"" in the title race.  The six-goal demolition of West Ham has shown Arsenal mean business and are determined to go toe-to-toe with Manchester City and Liverpool. It was vital they backed up their morale-boosting win over Liverpool the previous week with a victory at West Ham. And it was not just the three points - but the style in which they won. Arsenal have not been playing with the same flair and free-flowing style as last season and yet, at West Ham, they blitzed their London rivals with a sensational display. Saka, 22, said: âWe knew this was a big game and it was really important for us to win and make a statement. I think we did really well scoring six and keeping a clean sheet.â âArsenalâs win puts them right in the mix in a three-horse title race with just two points separating Mikel Artetaâs men from City and Liverpool. If Arsenal had managed one more goal, they would have overhauled City and gone into second on goal difference which just underlines how close it is at the top. City remain the bookiesâ favourites while Liverpool are top and Arsenal have been seen as the outsiders in recent weeks. Back-to-back defeats against West Ham at home and at Fulham between Christmas and New Year saw them get written off in some quarters. But since then, they have won four games in a row, smashing five past Crystal Palace, winning at Nottingham Forest and then beating Liverpool and West Ham. They had tripped up in their last three games with West Ham - blowing a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 at London Stadium last season, losing at home in December and getting knocked out of the Carabao Cup this season. But Arsenal know from the experiences of last season, it is more about how you finish the season than how you start it. Arsenal fell away last year in the title race when William Saliba got injured and Artetaâs men lost their defensive foundations. Arsenal have the meanest defence in the Premier League this time as they have conceded just 22 goals which is fewer than any other team. Saliba and Gabriel have been outstanding at centre half. All the talk about David Raya has quietened down which is perhaps the best compliment you can pay the Arsenal keeper. Ben White has been incredibly consistent. Left back has been an issue ever since Jurrien Timber got injured in the first game of the season. They have also seen Gabriel Jesus miss too many games and that has meant that it has been hard for Arsenal to field a settled first choice XI which was their biggest strength last season. They have scored 16 set piece goals which is the highest in the Premier League but the flip side of that is that it also exposes a lack of creativity and chances from open play. But the six goals they put past West Ham shows they are hitting form at the right time and appear to be in something of a groove. City have gained a reputation for being incredibly consistent during the run-in, winning game after game to blow the opposition away, That is what Arsenal must do now. Crucially, Saka is rediscovering form at the right time. That is highlighted by his willingness to step up and take the penalty at West Ham. Last season, Saka missed at West Ham when, if he had scored, it would have made it 3-1. Instead, Arsenal ended up being pegged back 2-2 and that was towards the start of a poor run which saw their title challenge unravel. However, Saka insists that he was never worried about taking the responsibility again. âIf youâre going to be a penalty taker I donât know any penalty taker that scores every single penalty,â Saka said after his man-of-the-match display took him to ten goals and seven assists. âIâm not happy to miss but I understand itâs part of the game so when I won the penalty I was ready to take it again and score. Iâve had many lessons in my career and the best choice is to learn and take the learning process which makes you stronger. âOf course I have my own targets. I know these days the media like to compare players. I just stay in my own lane and stay focused on what I want to achieve and what I wanted to achieve at the start of the season. Iâm still going and Iâve got quite a few more to go.â",âOf course I have my own targets. I know these days the media like to compare players.

230,Klinsmann 'needs to be replaced' as South Korea manager after Asian Cup exit,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Klinsmann-needs-to-be-replaced-as-South-Korea-manager-after-Asian-Cup-exit/3302430,17 hours ago,"South Korea's Football Association has advised sacking head coach Jurgen Klinsmann following their semi-final exit at the Asian Cup.  The German legend took charge of the South Korean national side in February 2023, with a contract through to the end of the 2026 World Cup. But an advisory committee within the Korea Football Association (KFA) has said that he should be removed from his post imminently, following criticism of his leadership, and the country's 2-0 defeat to Jordan in the Asian Cup semi-final last week. Reuters reports that while the committee has no official power for administrative decisions, there were already question marks over Klinsmann's role, with a brawl inside the camp adding to tensions ahead of the semi-final. South Korea were heavy favourites against Jordan, ranked 87th by FIFA, but succumbed to second half goals from Yazan Al-Naimat and Musa Al-Taamari.  Klinsmann's popularity plummeted during the tournament, with many fans and some politicians criticising the 59-year-old's demeanour. Klinsmann also faced repeated backlash for working from his home in Los Angeles, despite saying he would spend much of his time in South Korea - a move which was seen as 'disrespectful' by insiders. The meeting on Thursday saw Klinsmann join the proceedings by video call. After the meeting, Hwang Bo-kwan, the technical director at the association, told reporters: 'For various reasons, there was a conclusion that coach Klinsmann can no longer exercise leadership as the national teamâs coach and needs to be replaced.' The final decision will be made by KFA chairman Chung Mong-gyu. Former Tottenham player Klinsmann won the 1990 World Cup as a player, before becoming a manager of the Germany and USA national sides, as well as Bundesliga titans Bayern Munich. After Klinsmann's takeover last year, South Korea failed to win any of his first five games in charge, with two defeats and three draws, but they did pick up six consecutive wins heading into the Asian Cup. Hong Myung-bo, a former sweeper for the national side, is reportedly among the names being considered as a temporary replacement if Klinsmann is dismissed.   Tottenham's Son Heung-min dislocated his finger on the eve of South Korea's Asian Cup exit, following a bust-up between Son and his team-mates while they were eating on February 5, the day before the 2-0 defeat to Jordan. Reports claimed a number of young players had rushed eating so they could dash off and play table tennis, which infuriated the South Korea and Spurs captain. South Korea's Yonhap news agency first reported that Son initially tried to talk to the younger players â including PSG starlet Lee Kang-in â about bonding with their team-mates instead of rushing off to play table tennis.",South Korea's Yonhap news agency first reported that Son initially tried to talk to the younger players â including PSG starlet Lee Kang-in â about bonding with their team-mates instead of rushing off to play table tennis.

While in part he has been forced into it, the likes of Alejandro Balde, Hector Fort, Pau Cubarsi and Marc Guiu have all responded well, but the star of that show is Lamine Yamal. Still just 16, he continues to improve with every passing week.  In an interview with the Barcelona club media, carried by Sport, Lamine Yamal described what it was like to make his debut last season. âI went out to warm up when I entered the field my ears popped, I couldnât hear anything, it was like a minute, but in my legs it seemed like an hour.â He admitted that despite only playing 7 minutes, it took its toll on him. âI ended up very tired. I went out to the parking lot where my mother was and everyone was very happy. The next day I trained again with the first team. It was a day of great happiness because the next day I trained again.â Lamine Yamal went on to explain that he initially was just a child in the dressing room, but now has the respect of his teammates, and gets involveed more often, including in jokes. The 16-year-old will always be a fan of Xavi Hernandez though. âI will thank him because not just anyone makes you debut at 15 years old, and this season he has given me minutes in all the games I have been able to play.â âHe told me to enjoy doing, the same as in training and it would turn out well. That I come on play, to have fun.â Certainly he has been doing that in recent weeks. Lamine Yamal has undoutedly been their most dangerous forward over the last month, and has started their last five matches in a row. The concern will be that the pressure takes the fun out of it for such a young, mercurial talent. Image via JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images",Image via JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images
232,10 THINGS WE LEARNED from the Premier League...,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/10-THINGS-WE-LEARNED-from-the-Premier-League.../3301392,2 days ago,"Another weekend of Premier League action has been and gone.  Manchester City returned top of the Premier League table as Erling Haaland struck twice to sink Everton, while United breathed new life into their late Champions League push after beating Aston Villa 2-1 to move just six points off fourth place. Elsewhere, Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham side claimed a thrilling late victory at home when Brennan Johnson's 96th minute winner secured them all three points against Brighton. Chelsea claimed a much needed win against Crystal Palace. Conor Gallagher netted twice against the Eagles, where he spent last season on loan, and Fernandez secured the points in the fourth minute of added time at Selhurst Park to leave Palace just five points above the relegation zone. Mail Sport covers 10 things we learned from the weekend's Premier League action. Rasmus Hojlund endured a rough start to life in Manchester following his Â£72million move from Atalanta in the summer. Despite finding the back of the net in Europe, Hojlund went months without scoring in the league for United - until eventually bagging against Aston Villa in December. However, it appears as though Hojlund's luck has changed. The Danish international has collected 40 passes in the opposition's half since Christmas (an average of 8.1 times per match). His average before the Xmas break was 8.2. Prior to Christmas, Hojlund received the ball just three times inside the penalty area - marking out an average of 0.3 times per match. But, in the last couple months, Hojlund has received the ball inside the box 1.2 times per match - which has helped his upturn in form. Hojlund's progress could be seen during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon, where he opened the scoring in the 17th minute of the game with a fine finish.  Liverpool starlet Harvey Elliott made the difference against Burnley on Saturday afternoon, providing two match-winning assists after his half-time introduction by Jurgen Klopp. Elliott has started 25 Premier League games for Liverpool and has been a replacement in 35. It's not the ratio an ambitious 20-year-old would want, but he's proven himself as a super-sub. Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has said Elliott must avoid getting frustrated over his position on the bench. He said: 'Harvey goes through a lot of things personally. He would love to be playing week in, week out but playing at the highest level you also have to be patient and grab your moments when you get them. 'He has to keep going, don't be frustrated that you don't play as sometimes it is part of the business, but when you get your opportunities you have to perform and that's what he has done again.'  Pape Matar Sarr is providing Tottenham with a new lease of life. He has excelled this term and established himself as one of Ange Postecoglou's key men, making 31 Premier League appearances so far this season. The 21-year-old starlet played a key role in Tottenham's 2-1 win over Brighton on Saturday, finding the back of the net for Spurs upon his return from the Africa Cup of Nations. His midfield play showed why he is held in such high regard at the club. He enjoyed a successful first half but came into his own in the second before finding Tottenham's equaliser. He drilled the ball home from a tight angle with his left foot. It was a tough finish that deserved recognition and it's safe to say he got it. Sarr was clapped off the pitch after being subbed with 10 minutes to go for Ben Davies.  Ivan Toney only returned in January from an eight-month ban for breaching FA gambling rules. During his time on the sidelines, Toney - who is out of contract at the end of next season - had been linked with Chelsea and Arsenal. Many were wondering whether the links were justified for a player who had not featured for eight months. But, he has proven his doubters wrong. His latest performance exemplified his value to the team, scoring Brentford's second goal in their 2-0 win over Wolves. The striker has now scored three goals in his last four games - showing why he is one of the most capable forwards in the Premier League.  Chris Wilder is not focused on points, despite picking up three of them against Luton on Saturday afternoon. He said he was more focused on the squad's tactics, their connection to the fans and bouncing back from their 5-0 defeat to Aston Villa. 'Nobody has talked about the gap,' he said after the Luton game. 'We've just talked about the next game ever since we've come through the door. I know we've got 12 or 13 now, you don't know what's going to happen. You've just got to get your head down.' The Sheffield United manager went on to add: 'The biggest thing for me was the connection back with the supporters, it was 100 per cent that was what was needed.'  Manchester United's victory over Aston Villa proved crucial in the race for Champions league football, with the Red Devils closing the gap to just five points. Defeat also saw Unai Emery's side slip outside of the top four over the weekend, with Tottenham now a point ahead after their last 2-1 home against Brighton. It comes as no surprise the Villa fans are disappointed with the result considering Villa lost just three of their opening 18 Premier League matches this season. Now they have lost three of their last six fixtures - including back-to-back defeats at Villa Park, where they had previously gone almost a full year without losing.  There is no denying the fact Fulham have lacked a clinical goal scorer. The departure of Aleksandar Mitrovic left them sort of options but Rodrigo Muniz has stepped up to the plate. Fulham were boosted by the arrival of Armando Broja on loan from Chelsea, but it is Muniz has grabbed the headlines as of late - scoring three goals in two games for the Cottagers. He scored his first Premier League goals in their 2-2 draw with Burnley before bagging a brace against Bournemouth at home on Saturday afternoon. Some would say the No.9 spot is his to lose!  Forest have shown they are capable of threatening down the wing after acquiring United and Chelsea academy products, Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Both players gained exposure to Premier League football through their respective clubs before being allowed to join Nottingham Forest during the summer transfer window. Elanga and Hudson-Odoi both found the back of the net during Saturday's clash with Newcastle. The former Manchester United starlet scored his side's first goal in the 26nd minute before Hudson-Odoi added their second in the 45+6 minute. It wasn't enough to win the game as Bruno Guimaraes bagged a brace and Fabian Schar found the back of the net for the Magpies to see the game end 3-2 in their favour. But Elanga was a constant thorn in Newcastle's side. His pace caused Dan Burn several problems, while Hudson-Odoi enjoyed a lot of success cutting in from the left.  Set pieces have become a real strength for Arsenal. They scored their 15th and 16th goals from set pieces (excluding penalties) against West Ham on the weekend. They found the back of the net with a well-worked corner and then a free-kick in the first half of their 6-0 thumping over the Hammers. As a result, the Gunners are now topping the Premier League charts goals scored from set pieces - which is helping them close to gap on Liverpool and Man City. Having units such as Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba attacking the ball is certainly helping but the secret sauce appears to be in the delivery.  Erling Haaland regained his goalscoring form after returning to the scoresheet during Manchester City's 2-0 win over Everton on Saturday following an injury break. Haaland opened the scoring late in the second half to register his first goal since November - but that wasn't enough for the Norwegian, as he quickly doubled Manchester City's lead after cruising past Jarrad Branthwaite to fire the ball past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.  Fans were also quick to react to Haaland's performance, describing him as 'just too good.' Posting on X one user said: 'Haaland brushed Braithwaite like he was a piece of paper.' While another added: 'Haaland violated Braithwaite there' another penned.' Before one supporter finished by writing: 'The PLâs most feared duo are BACKâ¦ Kevin De Bruyne x Erling Haaland'.",While another added: 'Haaland violated Braithwaite there' another penned.'

233,Jude Bellingham is hailed by Real Madrid legend as an 'UNBELIEVABLE player',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Jude-Bellingham-is-hailed-by-Real-Madrid-legend-as-an-UNBELIEVABLE-player/3301383,2 days ago,"Jude Bellingham has been held aloft as an 'unbelievable player' by one of Real Madrid's all-time greats.  The 20-year-old has torched the history books since his Â£113million summer switch from Borussia Dortmund. He bagged 14 goals in his first 15 Madrid games, eclipsing the previous record of 13 held by Cristiano Ronaldo, Alfredo Di Stefano, and Pruden Sanchez. He also reached 20 goals for Real Madrid in 29 games, which is 126 appearances faster than fellow Englishman David Beckham did, and look at how highly he is thought of. Zinedine Zidane has been overjoyed - but not surprised - by the Englishman's scintillating form in the Spanish capital. 'Heâs an unbelievable player who does incredible things,' Zidane told Adidas via Mundo Deportivo.  'You could have imagined what he was going to do, but heâs surpassed all the statistics with what heâs doing. 'Donât forget that heâs only 20 years old. He arrived at Real Madrid with a lot of desire, a lot of goals and he is setting the bar very high. Heâs just showing everyone what he is and itâs great to see him like that. 'Iâm a big fan of his and now we want him to win trophies with Real Madrid. Itâs everything he wanted for himself. While Zidane purports not to be taken aback by Bellingham's red-hot form, he is changing games in a way unlike he had ever before. At Borussia Dortmund he played in a much deeper role and was not typically a blistering goal-scorer, though he did bag 14 strikes in his last season there. Deployed as a number 10 by Carlo Ancelotti, he has already scored 20 goals and registered eight assists. Even from his debut against Athletic Bilbao, in which he scored, he earned comparisons with Zidane for his swagger and guile. Zidane, currently out of work as a manager, led Real Madrid to three Champions League and two LaLiga titles in the dugout.  His haul at the club as a player included one LaLiga crown and a Champions League gong - as well as a legendary winner in the 2002 final. Bellingham will be hoping for even more than that and has already scored more in a single season than Zidane ever did for Los Blancos.",Bellingham will be hoping for even more than that and has already scored more in a single season than Zidane ever did for Los Blancos.
234,Situation of Real Madrid star Luka Modric âquite clearâ as contract runs down,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Situation-of-Real-Madrid-star-Luka-Modric-%E2%80%98quite-clear%E2%80%99-as-contract-runs-down/3301809,2 days ago,"Real Madrid have become used to saying their farewells to legendary figures in the summer over the last five years, and it appears they will be readying their media department again. Croatian superstar Luka Modric is closer to the exit door than heâs ever been since he arrived in the Spanish capital.  The 38-year-old signed a new one-year extension last summer, feeling he was able to compete for first-team minutes again. He finished last season starting the biggest games, but this year his role has been different since the start of the season. Thus far he has started just 15 of their 35 games, and that is despite injuries to Dani Ceballos, Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni. Diario ASÂ say that while in theory his future is uncertain, based on Modricâs previous declarations, it seem quite clear that he will leave in the summer, unless he has changed his mind about accepting a lesser role. The desire of Florentino Perez to have just one of Modric or Toni Kroos on the pitch during important games, combined with the stellar form of the latter has limited Modricâs opportunities. While he has played 27 times, and has 7 goal contributions in less than 1400 minutes, Modric has felt like the penultimate in the pecking order, only ahead of Ceballos. While he turned down an offer from Saudi Arabia last summer, it is not yet clear whether he will head to the Middle East, or perhaps even call time on his career.","While he turned down an offer from Saudi Arabia last summer, it is not yet clear whether he will head to the Middle East, or perhaps even call time on his career."

It was Kylian Mbappe that opened the scoring for the hosts in the second half, and that has now been added to by Bradley Barcola, who finished off a fine move by poking the ball under the onrushing Alex Remiro.","It was Kylian Mbappe that opened the scoring for the hosts in the second half, and that has now been added to by Bradley Barcola, who finished off a fine move by poking the ball under the onrushing Alex Remiro."
236,Chris Wilder charged by FA for rant at assistant referee for eating sandwich,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chris-Wilder-charged-by-FA-for-rant-at-assistant-referee-for-eating-sandwich/3301798,2 days ago,"Chris Wilder has been charged by the FA after tearing into an official following Sheffield United's 3-2 loss at Crystal Palace last month.  He branded referee Tony Harrington's performance as 'ridiculous' and accused a linesman of a 'complete lack of respect' for eating a sandwich in a post-match meeting. The Blades' boss was irate that Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta went unpunished after a collision with new goalkeeper Ivo Grbic, who was withdrawn with a concussion, and had broader problems with the standard of officiating. On Wednesday the FA announced that he has been charged for comments which allegedly brought the game into disrepute. 'Chris Wilder has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3.1 in relation to media comments that followed Sheffield United's Premier League match against Crystal Palace on Tuesday 30 January.' The statement read.  'It's alleged that the manager's comments constitute improper conduct in that they imply bias and/or attack the integrity of the referee, or referees generally, and/or bring the game into disrepute. 'Chris Wilder has until Friday, 16 February, to provide hos response.' The Blades boss had fumed in a post-match interview following the defeat to the Eagles last month. 'It's yet again another ridiculous performance from the referee,' Wilder told BBC Sport. 'I was told by a Premier League referee, who I've known for a long time and who's as honest as the day is long, he said get ready because every tight decision will go against you. 'He said every 50/50 decision will go against you. We had two bookings in the first half of the game but they weren't bookings. They were just a coming together. 'Their boy absolutely takes our goalkeeper out, we have to change goalkeepers and the boy doesn't get booked. He says it was an accident, he clashed, it makes no odds if it's an accident or it's not an accident. It's a yellow card. 'We pick up four yellow cards, they pick up one at the death for time wasting. They're taking an age. Their game management was good, but they're taking an age. 'We talked with Howard Webb about speeding the game up and making sure that referees have got a grip on that and he could hear the frustration for the supporters. He could see our frustration from our players.  'Every 50/50 or tight decision goes against us and if that's what we're going to have to deal with between now and the end of the season, we're going to deal with it. 'But I'm not just going to go under the radar and not say anything. I've been to see the referee and I've told him that. 'One of his assistants was eating a sandwich at the time, which I thought was a complete lack of respect. Hopefully he enjoyed his sandwich while he was talking to a Premier League manager.' It's not clear whether Dan Cook or Mark Scholes was the hungry linesman in question. Sheffield United's crisis then deepened with a 5-0 defeat at home by Aston VIlla, leaving them 20th in the table and 10 points adrift of safety. However, they were able to breath new life into their survival bid with a 3-1 win over Luton in their last outing. Asked if he would follow up his complaints with Webb, Wilder had said: 'The same happened Saturday [against Brighton in the FA Cup]. 'Boys going down and conning the supporters, trying to con the referee. Every tight decision yet again. It's happened too many times for me not to say anything. I'm not deflecting anything, I'll say it as it is and that's how I feel. 'It wasn't an aggressive match, it was a competitive match. Both teams have got respect for each other, I certainly have got a load of respect for Roy Hodgson and Ray Lewington and those guys here.  'It was competitive, nobody went out to seriously injure anyone and we end up picking four bookings up. And like I said, every tight decision goes against us which, you know, for me is not acceptable.' Wilder is not the first to land himself in potential hot water for ripping into referees.

238,Chelsea Women make offer to Champions League-winning coach to replace Emma Hayes,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-Women-make-offer-to-Champions-League-winning-coach-to-replace-Emma-Hayes/3301788,2 days ago,"The hunt for Emma Hayesâ replacement could be over with Chelsea Women having offered a contact to Lyon head coach Sonia Bompastor.  The long-time Blues boss will depart at the end of the season as she takes up the vacant manager position with the USWNT. Selecting the candidate to replace one of womenâs footballâs most successful and influential managers in history was always going to prove to be a challenge. And while the process is still ongoing. Chelsea have zeroed in on the former Champions League winner Bompastor with the club negotiating a deal to appoint her, according to the Athletic. The 43-year-old â who won the Champions League as a player and manager â was promoted to womenâs head coach from her role within the Lyon academy following the departure of Jean-Luc Vasseur in April 2021. Her contract with the French giants is set to expire next year. Bompastorâs tenure at Lyon was successful almost from the start, with the new manager leading Lyon to a comfortable double as they won the Division 1 Feminine and the Womenâs Champions League. In total, Lyon went undefeated in 22 league matches that season while comprehensively beating Barcelona 3-1 in the final of the Champions League. The following season saw Lyon retain their league title, though a disappointing quarter-final exit from the Champions League awaited as they lost in a penalty shootout to Chelsea following a 2-2 aggregate tie over two legs. If Bombastor is to take the Chelsea position, she will be greeted by familiar faces. Indeed, both Catarina Macario and Kadeisha Buchanan were coached by Bompastor at Lyon before their transfers to west London in 2023 and 2022 respectively. Lyon are currently into the quarter-finals of the Champions League again this season, while they are 10 points clear of Paris Saint-Germain in the French top flight. Bombastorâs managerial success is an extension of the success she relished as a player, winning eight league titles across her stints at Montpellier and Lyon, as well as two Champions Leagues at the latter. Such a pedigree will be crucial if she is to replace Hayes. Since joining Chelsea in 2012, the 47-year-old has led the club to six WSL titles, five FA Cups, two FA Womenâs League Cups, one FA Womenâs Spring Series trophy, and one Womenâs Community Shield. San Diego Wave and former Manchester United Women manager Casey Stoney was one of the leading candidates to take over from Hayes, but the ex-England defender has since signed a new deal with the Wave keeping her in the NWSL. Meanwhile, Laura Harvey, a former Arsenal manager now at Seattle Reign, was a club guest at Stamford Bridge for the Champions League match against Hacken in December - but recently indicated that she too is happy in the USA.","Meanwhile, Laura Harvey, a former Arsenal manager now at Seattle Reign, was a club guest at Stamford Bridge for the Champions League match against Hacken in December - but recently indicated that she too is happy in the USA."

The message held up in the Auteuil stand of the Parc des Princes read, âHidalgo kills Paris and itâs magicâ. This was accompanied by chants of âHidalgo Resignâ. The banner was unveiled in the same week it was confirmed that PSG would be leaving the Parc des Princes due to the unwillingness of the mayor to the French capital to sell the stadium to the Ligue 1 champions. Speaking to Ouest-France, Hidalgo said, ââll also say this again today, and in good faith to everyone: there will be no sale of the Parc des Princes. It is the heritage of the Parisian people. The subject is closed.â Following these quotes from Hidalgo, PSGâs president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi has confirmed that the clubâs residency at the Parc des Princes is âoverâ.

240,What's wrong with Grealish? 3 reasons why the Â£100m man's season is unravelling,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Whats-wrong-with-Grealish-3-reasons-why-the-%C2%A3100m-mans-season-is-unravelling/3301796,2 days ago,"In a way, that Jack Grealish insisted on playing on said it all. Even though he instantly knew the injury was muscular, and had been thumping the turf in agony, he wanted to give it another go.  Against the wishes of Pep Guardiola, who appeared to be telling the winger that he had nothing to prove and not to do any further damage. In the end, Grealish lasted another 90 seconds before begging Manchester City team mates to boot the ball into the stand so he could join it. Guardiola is right and wrong with that assessment. Grealish has nothing but everything to prove and the look of distraught as he realised his night in Copenhagen was over felt instructive. Crucial in the Treble, and becoming the defining image of that success as he basked in the Manchester rain during their parade, Grealish has not hit anywhere near the same heights this season, one that has included a traumatic break-in at his new Cheshire home â heâs purchased two new protection dogs - and now a court appearance for a driving offence. Only seven Premier League starts and Tuesday night had been the first time Guardiola picked him for over a month. It canât be particularly easy watching Kevin De Bruyne roar back after six months out and have the manager compare him to a Brunello di Montalcino or Sassicaia.   So the opportunity in the Champions League was something Grealish wanted to grab and for it to end after 21 minutes summed up a campaign that has never got moving. Heâs cut a very frustrated figure in training recently, desperate to play. Frustrated enough for Guardiola to remark upon it. Itâs not like Grealish, the gregarious dressing room DJ, to allow that to show. The players have noticed too. âMaybe heâs a bit down that he didnât play as much but heâs still fighting,â Nathan Ake said earlier this week. Heâd clearly channelled that in a more productive way in the build-up to the last 16 first leg on a night when Guardiola picked arguably his best starting XI. Grealish always finds a place in the best team â especially at this stage of the season. The games will become tighter, City will face better opposition more regularly and his unique style of control from the left-hand side is something Guardiola requires. Heâs always there for the big games. With three goals and two assists in 26 games, Grealish has never troubled â and will never trouble â the scorers in terms of goal contributions but has constantly offered more in other areas. The balance he brings, the slowing down of games with the perfect tempo, is a valuable commodity to a team that strangles others with possession. This is why itâs not only him who anxiously waits the results of tests for the groin injury. City need him. But weeks out now could severely impact his prospects of being fully involved when the silverware starts to shimmer because once Guardiola settles on a formula at the business end, itâs very hard for anyone to change it. Thatâs the challenge. And that will have the 28-year-old thinking about the summer, about the England squad for the European Championship. Heâll be there in Germany but at the moment, doesnât get into Gareth Southgateâs preferred side. And that spot, supplying Harry Kane off the flank, is one that really is up for grabs.    Marcus Rashford had had ups and downs this year. There is a clamour for Phil Foden to operate with Jude Bellingham in the middle. Raheem Sterling appears to be out of the international picture. Does James Maddison find himself squeezed in over there? Jarrod Bowen has been knocking around. Cole Palmerâs not a natural on that side. None of it is fixed, probably providing Southgate with his biggest headache, and this run to the tournament should be Grealishâs shop window. All of this and more was worn in his face on Parkenâs touchline, staring ahead disconsolate. Heâd barely perked up while walking out with Foden to board the team bus two hours later; nobody can really blame him for that. And yet, the drama surrounding his early exit was only exacerbated because of the six months prior and a sense that Grealish is playing catch up. Heâd found Jeremy Doku, the electric and unpredictable Belgian, ahead of him as City attempting to bed the youngster in. City were becoming more direct, using more runners with the ball â embodied by the Â£55million summer signing from Rennes whose primary function is to embarrass full backs. Oscar Bobbâs snapping at their heels too. Dokuâs arrival coincided with a dip in Grealishâs form â and a dead leg, leaving him unable to walk - after the heroics of last year. There are some in this squad who can easily forget, can easily move onto the next thing. Grealish is not one of those people and there is an acceptance around City that it has taken him far longer to shake off the Treble than others. Plenty of Guardiolaâs stars are used to winning every year but for Grealish, to lift everything after a career spent at Aston Villa was harder to process. âI am not saying it is hard to get motivated - you canât say that,â he said on England duty a few months back. âBut when youâve done it, itâs kind of like, âWhat now?â Do you know what I mean?â In November, Guardiola said that he wanted him âangryâ at a lack of starts. Heâd seen him perform superbly during the victory at Old Trafford â âJack is back, he gave us more composure and pausaâ â only for displays to drop off.    An encouraging appearance at Everton helped them win the game over New Year before he was then again out of the team following an average afternoon against Sheffield United. There has been no real consistency. Grealish would argue that he hasnât been afforded the chance to build consistency. âThis season was not like last season, but he's getting better,â Guardiola said last week. âLately he is getting better. He's doing the steps to get to his best level and now is competing with players at a high level.â That seemed bang on during the opening exchanges in Copenhagen, with Grealish knitting City together, only for yet another setback.

241,10 THINGS WE LEARNED from LaLiga...,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/10-THINGS-WE-LEARNED-from-LaLiga.../3301357,14 Feb,"Joan Laporta had a one-man battle with the buffet on Sunday night as Barcelona turned in another awful display against Granada.  The previous night Real Madrid blew away Girona's title challenge with Vinicius and Jude Bellingham proving unstoppable on the night. Meanwhile, Diego Simeone's Atletico slipped in the league and Sevilla's find of the season, Isaac Romero, eased their relegation fears with another goal. Here are the 10 things we learned from Spain this weekend.  The deep fried prawns and Spanish omelette bites were flying in hospitality at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona on Sunday night after club president Joan Laporta took his ire out on the canapes following Barcelona's 3-3 draw with relegation favourites Granada. At least that is what Radio Catalonia was reporting after the game. He's believed to have turned over at least one tray of finger food. It's hard to know what will have upset him more: the performance, or the fact that some fans chanted against him as president? Barcelona trail Real Madrid by 10 points and although there are 14 games left it's hard to see how Barcelona can go on a run of winning a decent portion of those games, or how Real Madrid can go on a run of losing a decent portion of those games. What seems more likely is that Barcelona will spiral into further chaos as they realise keeping Xavi is costing them a place in the top two, and so their place in the lucrative Spanish Super Cup next season.  It was something about the way he didn't really celebrate when he scored from outside the area to make it 3-3 that drove home the fact that Lamine Yamal plays and carries himself more like an establish star at Barcelona than any else. Barca's best player so far this season will not be 17 until June. He is the only thing they can be positive about at the moment, and he knew a draw against Granada was nothing to shout about.  'I don't usually shoot from outside the area' he said after his brilliant performance powered Real Madrid to victory over Girona on Saturday night. He also doesn't usually play Luka Modric-style passes like the one with the outside of his foot that set up Jude Bellingham for Real Madrid's second goal. He is becoming a more complete player than he was last season.  The French great scored nine league goals in two of his five seasons at Real Madrid. Jude Bellingham is already on 16 and ought to finish with more than double that figure. To think some scoffed when he took Zidane's old No 5 shirt and was compared to him in the summer. What he needs to do now is lead England to glory in the way that 'Zizou' led France. At least his ankle injury is just a strain and should not mean he misses any more than four Real Madrid games. He'll be back to meet Vinicius as well when England play Brazil on March 23.  Girona paid for a massive sign that read 'Curriculum is not everything' in the middle of Madrid in the build-up to their game with the club that has won the Spanish league 35 times. It's true that history can't win you things in the here and now but Carlo Ancelotti has a claim to be football's finest-ever manager precisely because he prepares teams to be at their best when it matters most. Girona's marketing was inspired but on the pitch only Madrid were at the level. No one has scored more goals with his head this season (five) and Real Madrid were missing all four of their centre-backs through injury. With full-back Dani Carvajal and midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni in centre-defence Madrid could have been there for the taking, instead LaLiga's top scorers going into the game failed to muster a shot on target, much less a header from Dovbyk against that diminutive defence. The 'no Isco, no Disco' doomsday scenario didn't come to pass for Betis who comfortably beat Cadiz 2-0 away on Friday without their talisman who's out for a month with a hamstring tear. Manuel Pellegrini is still on course to guide Betis into Europe and Mauricio Pellegrino's arrival looks to have done nothing to halt Cadiz's slide into the second tier.  Diego Simeone complained about the fact that Atletico Madrid play next Saturday and their Champions League rivals Inter, who they play the following Tuesday, will have played their Serie A game 24 hours before. 'Inter play Friday; we play Saturday thanks LaLiga and the Spanish Federation,' Simeone said sarcastically. It's convenient to shift the focus from a disastrous league campaign. He has as good a squad as Real Madrid and yet the gap with so many games left is now 13 points.  Who knows what kind of season Sevilla might have had if they had promoted B-team striker Isaac Romero to the first team earlier. He has five goals in his first seven games for the club and his winner on Saturday against Atletico Madrid takes them much closer to safety.",He has five goals in his first seven games for the club and his winner on Saturday against Atletico Madrid takes them much closer to safety.
242,Tuchel's message to Bayern Munich players in 'explosive dressing room statement',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tuchels-message-to-Bayern-Munich-players-in-explosive-dressing-room-statement/3302660,17 hours ago,"Thomas Tuchel berated his Bayern Munich players with a withering statement after their 3-0 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, it has been revealed.  The Bayern boss is said to have 'caused a stir' in the dressing room with his wounding words after the Saturday drubbing. Bayern are five points behind Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen in the Bundesliga title race and seriously risk losing their 11-year streak of winning the league. In an explosive statement, Tuchel told his players: 'You're not as good as I thought, then I just have to adapt to your level,' according to Sky Germany. Pressure is bubbling up at one of Europe's biggest clubs after their Champions Legaue hopes were left hanging in the balance with a 1-0 loss at Lazio in the last 16 on Wednesday night.  Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg suggests that Tuchel must win at Bochum on Sunday. While Bayern are not planning to sack him yet, the upcoming fixtures against Bochum, Leipzig and Freiburg, and the return leg against Lazio are pivotal to Tuchel's future. Kane has now received the lowest rating possible in Bild's evaluation in back-to-back games, with tabloid Bild labelling his performance against Leverkusen a 'catastrophe'. Rio Ferdinand tore into an 'ugly performance' on TNT Sports and believes Bayern will struggle to emerge form their 'rut' before the second leg in March. Jamie Carragher diagnosed them as a 'team of individuals' and thinks their chances of winning the Champions League have been shot by the result and performance. Sky Germany pundit Marcel Reif said: 'I think he puts himself above the team and a huge gap arises between himself and the team 'In Rome I didn't have the impression that the team was saying: ""That really motivated me.""' Even through Champions League pain, Bayern have been able to rely on relentless form and dominance domestically - but that isn't the case. Harry Kane had a debut to forget in August as Bayern were beaten 3-0 in the German Super Cup by RB Leipzig. Then, in November, they were stunned by Saarbrucken, crashing out of the DFB-Pokal to the third-tier side with a 2-1 loss.    Now five points behind an unbeaten Leverkusen, their chances of winning any silverware this season are receding. It's understandable for Tuchel to rant and want to motivate his players, but if there is a 'rift' as Reif suggests, it will be difficult to drag his players with him by deploying stinging words.","It's understandable for Tuchel to rant and want to motivate his players, but if there is a 'rift' as Reif suggests, it will be difficult to drag his players with him by deploying stinging words."
243,"PLAYER RATINGS: Elliott dazzles off the bench, Endo shows what Reds were missing",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/PLAYER-RATINGS-Elliott-dazzles-off-the-bench-Endo-shows-what-Reds-were-missing/3298860,11 Feb,"Liverpool climbed back to the top of the Premier League on Saturday with a 3-1 victory over Burnley, courtesy of well-taken goals by Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.  The Reds temporarily conceded first place to Manchester City after the champions' 2-0 triumph over Everton at the Etihad hours before, but Jurgen Klopp's side kept their composure to put in a professional performance and claim all three points at Anfield. Creating Jota's opener in the first half, Trent Alexander-Arnold broke the record for the most assists in Premier League history by a defender, shortly before departing at the break for Liverpool substitute Harvey Elliott. Meanwhile, Sheffield United's triumph over Luton put Burnley level on points with the Blades at the foot of the Premier League table, with Vincent Kompany's side set to face title hopefuls Arsenal up next. Mail Sport assesses the stars' performances from the match, providing a rating for each player.  Caoimhin Kelleher 6 Deputised well in Alisson's absence and was quick off his line to deny Fofana. Little he could have done about the Burnley goal. Trent Alexander-Arnold 6 Wrote his name into the Premier League history books by becoming the all-time record assist-maker among defenders. Not his best display defensively. Jarell Quansah 5.5 Had his blushed spared by Kelleher after making a meal of his clearance and had to be cautious once booked. But otherwise a solid display from the youngster. Virgil van Dijk 6 Did the basics well and dealt with Burnley's aerial threat with ease. Defended as one would expect him to but lacked his usual positivity with long-range passes. Andrew Robertson 6.5 A tidy return for the Scot once he grew into the game. Flooded the box with several trademark deliveries from the left-hand side and proved a menace for the Clarets. Wataru Endo 7 Showed Liverpool fans what they were missing against Arsenal. Broke up play brilliantly and helped steady the ship at 1-1. Should have done better for the goal.   Curtis Jones 6.5 Managed the tempo well in midfield until he was forced to deputise at right-back from half time. Showcased his versatility superbly in what was an unnatural position. Alexis Mac Allister 6.5 Given extra freedom alongside Endo in midfield and didn't set the world alight creatively. Otherwise, a decent display from the switched-on Argentine. Diogo Jota 7 Among the goals again and covering Mohamed Salah's absence exceptionally. Set the tone with a great header but snatched at a couple of shots unnecessarily. Darwin Nunez 6 Had an extremely quiet first half but always posed a threat in attack. Patience finally paid off with a well-taken goal in what was another spirited performance. Luis Diaz 7 Grabbed the most important goal of the game to swing momentum in Liverpool's favour. Didn't always execute his wide play perfectly but posed a threat nonetheless. Substitutes: Harvey Elliott (45') 7.5 Changed the game after his introduction with positive runs and creative passing. Boosted Liverpool's confidence at a time when things were looking nervy for them. Cody Gakpo (82') N/A Konstantinos Tsimikas (90') N/A Bobby Clark (90') N/A James McConnell (90') N/A   James Trafford 6 Under increasing pressure from Liverpool, the 'keeper pulled off some fine saves but was at fault for the Reds' opener. Lorenz Assignon 7 Did well to deny a rampant Liverpool as their stature grew in the second-half. Dara O'Shea 7 Helped provide Burnley a consolation and keep Liverpool from keeping a clean sheet with a lovely bulleted header. Maxime Esteve 6 Distinguished himself with his first Premier League start after signing during the January window. Hannes Delcroix 6 Tried to keep a lid on Alexander-Arnold but found himself unable to fully suppress the defender. Josh Brownhill 6 Provided a fine assist from a Burnley corner for O'Shea's solitary goal. Sander Berge 7 Spurred on Burnley's front-footed start and helped the away side keep up pressure on the Reds before they settled. Aaron Ramsey 6 Tangled up with Mac Allister in the VAR squabble before Liverpool's second was allowed to stand, and could have been cleverer to help deny the hosts. Wilson Odobert 6.5 Showed off strong ball-carrying skills to get Burnley's attack up and running.   David Fofana 5.5 Unable to replicate his heroics against Fulham to launch a Burnley fight-back, missing a number of strong chances. Zeki Amdouni 6 Tested Kelleher well in the first-half, and helped add menance to the visitors' attack. Substitutes: Vitinho (80') N/A Han-Noah Massengo (81') N/A Jacob Bruun Larsen (86') N/A",Jacob Bruun Larsen (86') N/A

Modric opted to continue his policy of signing one year contract extensions at the start of the current campaign. However, that pattern will change this summer, with the Croatian star frustrated by his lack of game time in Madrid. Despite assurances over his place in the squad, the veteran midfielder has played a bit-part role, and he will end his 12-year bond with the club in the coming months.  Real Madrid will not attempt to convince Modric to change his mind out of respect for his service in their success since joining in 2012. Modric will lead Croatia at Euro 2024, before making a decision over his next step, with a retirement an option for the 38-year-old. He is expected to receive a renewed offer from the Saudi Pro League, following their 2023 interest, with reports from Mundo Deportivo claiming a rival bid is incoming from Major League Soccer.","He is expected to receive a renewed offer from the Saudi Pro League, following their 2023 interest, with reports from Mundo Deportivo claiming a rival bid is incoming from Major League Soccer."
245,Matteo Moretto Transfer Column: Nico Williams still attracting interest,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Matteo-Moretto-Transfer-Column-Nico-Williams-still-attracting-interest/3300776,12 Feb,"Matteo Moretto gives Football EspaÃ±a exclusive information on the latest deals dominating the papers in Spain, as revealed in the Daily Briefing.  Spain star Nico Williams is very grateful to Athletic Club and is very happy with his career there. In the summer there will undoubtedly be clubs that will ask for information, and possibly try to make a move for him, because Nico is one of the best talents in his position. Before Arsenal and Chelsea, Real Madrid and Barcelona were also linked, but before he signed his new deal, and itâs too early to talk about any club in particular. Make no mistake though, he is a very popular player for clubs from the Premier League, La Liga and Italy. Real Madrid are obviously trying to make a move for Bayern Munichâs Alphonso Davies, and previously we discussed that Miguel Gutierrez could be an alternative to the Canadian if they cannot extract him from Bavaria. Regarding the futures of Fran Garcia and Ferland Mendy, the two left-backs currently available, itâs still a developing situation. Itâs true that Mendy is well thought of in Saudi Arabia, hence the links, but they sounded him out in the summer, so itâs no sure thing they will come back in for him. Despite struggling against Real Madrid, Yan Couto has been excellent this season, and that explains the previous links to Los Blancos, although I canât speak to them yet. Equally, there are several European clubs that are following Couto, and Manchester City could give the go-ahead for his departure in the summer. Couto is due to return to City from his loan at Girona this summer, and only has a year remaining on his deal, but as of now, nobody has opened talks for Couto.","Despite struggling against Real Madrid, Yan Couto has been excellent this season, and that explains the previous links to Los Blancos, although I canât speak to them yet.

247,Celebrating when a player from every club raced 100m â & the hungover one won,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Celebrating-when-a-player-from-every-club-raced-100m-%E2%80%93--the-hungover-one-won/3301951,1 day ago,"Imagine how amazing it would be if the fastest player from every club in the top four divisions competed against each other to be crowned the fastest of all.  Now imagine if the player who eventually won it did it with a steaming hangover. In 1992, that actually happened. If it was to happen in such circumstances these days, sports scientists across the country would have a fit. Raymond Verheijen would break Twitter. But football was very different back in 1992 when League Cup sponsor Rumbelows, an electrical retailer which rivalled Dixons, Currys and Comet â not very successfully, as it turned out â set about finding the fastest player in the four divisions of the Football League. Rumbelows were serious about it, too. They stumped up a Â£10,000 cash prize for the winner, which was a huge sum even for the First Division stars, let alone the journeymen in the lower tiers. To get their hands on the cash, entrants â one from each of the 92 clubs â would have to negotiate their way through one of six regional heats before the winner and runner-up of each heat were joined by the four fastest losers at Wembley. The sprint semi-finals and final were to be the curtain raiser for the League Cup final between Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. Just imagine that for a second â instead of the usual pre-match âentertainmentâ we get nowadays before such games, picture Hector Bellerin, Jamie Vardy and the rest of the countryâs quickest footballers sprinting down the side of the pitch before kick-off. It would be sensational. The grandeur of the occasion, however, did not stop Swansea Cityâs entrant John Williams turning up with a raging hangover. Williams, who went on to score the second ever goal in the Premier League seven minutes after the first by Brian Deane, had played 90 minutes for the Swans on the Saturday, scoring in a 1-1 draw at Darlington in Division Three, before making a 230-mile trek via team coach and train down to the Watford Hilton. Rumbelows paid expenses for each finalist and a companion, so Williams took Jon Ford, a team-mate who was celebrating his birthday. âWe had some steak and chips, and because it was Jonâs birthday I said, âCome on, letâs celebrate with a couple of pints,ââ Williams told FourFourTwo. We all know the direction in which this is headingâ¦ âOne became two and three became four. We had a bottle of champagne and then we got on the spirits. I was paralytic. I think I ended up back in my room at 3am. I threw up and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in a bath. âJon was spraying me in the face with cold water, there was a shockwave and it drove me crazy. I started to attack him. Then I realised what was going on â he was shouting at me, âWeâre late! Weâre late!ââ Luckily, as he had already demonstrated, Williams could shift when he had to, and he made it in time to the start line beneath Wembleyâs twin towers. There gathered the qualifiers from the regions, all vying for 10 grand. Central West region Louie Donowa (Birmingham City), Rod McDonald (Walsall) Central East region Kevin Bartlett (Notts County), Paul Fleming (Mansfield Town) South & South East region John Williams (Swansea City), Michael Gilkes (Reading) North & North West region Keith Curle (Manchester City), Stuart Storer (Bolton Wanderers) London & South East region Tony Witter (Queens Park Rangers), John Goodman (Millwall) North & North East region Leigh Jenkinson (Hull City), Adrian Littlejohn (Sheffield United) Four fastest losers: Darren Wassall (Nottingham Forest, transferred to Derby since the qualifiers), Junior Bent (Bristol City), Efan Ekoku (AFC Bournemouth), Iffy Onuora (Huddersfield Town) Kevin Bartlett was the fastest in qualifying for Wembley, covering the 100 yards in 11.40 seconds. The Notts County flier was duly made the favourite by Ladbrokes, with Saint and Greavsie joining Bartlettâs team-mates in heavily backing the striker before he was priced at evens just prior to the starter squeezing the trigger on his pistol. But what the bookies didnât know is that their favourite had been carrying an injury in the weeks leading up to Wembley. Alan Parry, meanwhile, had lumped on Manchester Cityâs Keith Curle, but a tasty reception from the United fans on the day may have contributed to him being dumped out in the semi-finals. So Williams and Bartlett were joined in the final by Jenkinson, Gilkes, Littlejohn, Witter, Ekoku and Fleming. Notts County, QPR and Sheffield United represented the top-flight clubs, while the rest of the field comprised a quartet from Division Three and a sole representative from Division Four. Williams, fearful his hangover would mean he might not get back up again if he got down into a traditional sprinterâs start, opted for a standing start. Bartlett, however, suffered a far worse start and was still in the pack at the 50-yard stage, by which point, like Usain Bolt, the six-feet-one-inch Williams opened up his long legs as the hangover fog began to clear with the finish line coming into sight. By the time it arrived, there was no need even for Williams to dip. The Swansea striker won by a considerable length. âYes, you might well thank a superior power for that one,â proclaimed Parry as Williams blew a kiss skywards in celebration. âHeâs had a smashing weekend,â said the commentator, presumably blissfully unaware of the events that led to the newly-crowned fastest footballer in Britain spending the night before sleeping in a Watford Hilton bathtub. âHe wouldnât disgrace many sprinting tracks around the world,â said Steve Cram of Williamsâ performance. âIf his team doesnât do so well, he might want to look at the Olympic trials later on in the year!â Williams not only pocketed the Â£10,000 winning prize but also arranged a tidy bonus from Ladbrokes, as did a few of his Swansea team-mates who backed him at 16/1. âQuite a few of it was mine, yeah,â he replied when it was put to him by Gary Newbon that hundreds of pounds had been wagered in South Wales. âFor a player in the lower divisions, that is some payday,â said Parry â but Rumbelows were almost unable to pay it. The company, which never made a profit in 24 years of trading and by that time were losing Â£12million a year, disappeared from the high street not long after, but Williams did receive his Â£10,000 prize: âI couldnât believe it. I put down a deposit on a house and bought a car, a Peugeot 205 GTI 1.9.â We suspect it would take rather more than Â£10,000 to convince the Premier League stars of today to take on the challengeâ¦but we can dream.","We suspect it would take rather more than Â£10,000 to convince the Premier League stars of today to take on the challengeâ¦but we can dream."
248,5 things we learned from the Africa Cup of Nations,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/5-things-we-learned-from-the-Africa-Cup-of-Nations/3300796,12 Feb,"Ivory Coast brought the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations to a dramatic end on Sunday beating Nigeria 2-1 in the final to become champions for the third time. The Elephants were the story of the competition as they sacked manager Jean-Louis Gasset after a poor group-stage performance and still went on to lift the trophy. Here, the PA news agency looks at highlights from the latest edition. After a shock 4-0 defeat to Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast looked certain for an early exit. The Ivorian Football Federation sacked French manager Gasset afterwards and brought in former player Emerse Fae. Having scraped through to the knockout rounds, they edged past big favourites and defending champions Senegal on penalties in the round of 16 in Faeâs first game in charge, then beat Mali in extra-time in the quarter-finals and secured a 1-0 victory over DR Congo in the last four. Given the nickname âZombiesâ, they came back from the dead once again to beat Nigeria 2-1 in the final after going behind, proving you should never write off the Ivory Coast. APTOPIX Ivory Coast AFCON Soccer  It was a tournament to forget for Ghana as they failed to make it out of the group stages with just two draws and a defeat. A team that included West Ham star Mohammed Kudus, Crystal Palace veteran Jordan Ayew and Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams struggled to help Ghana make any progress in the competition. Former Brighton manager Chris Hughton was sacked after less than 12 months in charge and the Black Stars have started their search for a new coach before the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in June. Not many would have predicted South Africa would reach the semi-finals of the tournament and Bafana Bafana certainly caught the eye. Their biggest challenge came when they took on 2022 World Cup semi-finalists Morocco in the round of 16. Goals from Evidence Makgopa and Teboho Mokoena sealed a famous 2-0 victory as PSG star Achraf Hakimi missed a penalty late on for the Moroccans. Ivory Coast AFCON Soccer  Mauritania qualified for AFCON for the first time in their history in 2018 and heading into this yearâs competition they had new hopes of improving on their last performance. The Lions of Chinguetti were still searching for their first win heading into the last group game against Algeria and they pulled it off with a shock 1-0 victory to also send them to their first knockout match against Cape Verde. Mauritania could not pull off another upset against Cape Verde but they sealed their place in AFCON history with an impressive performance. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) confirmed more than two billion people worldwide watched the tournament live on TV. Deals with many broadcasters, including Sky and BBC, have helped boost figures for the competition and CAF president Patrice Motsepe predicts the next tournamentâs viewing figures will be even better.","The Confederation of African Football (CAF) confirmed more than two billion people worldwide watched the tournament live on TV.

249,Arsenal news: Emile Smith Rowe wades in on Arteta debate as next Saka called up,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-news-Emile-Smith-Rowe-wades-in-on-Arteta-debate-as-next-Saka-called-up/3299261,11 Feb,"Arsenal sit third in the Premier League table and Mikel Arteta will be well aware anything less than a win at West Ham would seriously damage their title hopes.  On a weekend that has seen both of the Gunners' title rivals pick up all three points in Manchester City and Liverpool, Arsenal need to do exactly the same at the home of their London rivals. However, that is easier said than done, especially given Arteta's men have already been beaten twice by the Hammers this term - once in the Carabao Cup, the other in the league. The London Stadium was also where, for some, last season's title tilt fell apart as Arsenal surrendered a two-goal lead while talismanic forward Bukayo Saka missed a penalty. Arteta will be desperate to avoid similar heartache this time around. With that being said, Mirror Football has analysed some of the main Gunners-related headlines emerging out of the Emirates on Sunday, February 11. Arsenal ace Gabriel Magalhaes has revealed what was said between him and Arteta at the start of this season after the Brazil international was dropped from the starting line-up for the first three games of the campaign. At the time, Arteta's decision sparked plenty of speculation that suggested Gabriel was bound for the Emirates exit. However, the 26-year-old himself has since shed light on that time in his Arsenal career. ""It was tough, obviously at the start,"" the 26-year-old said. ""I wanted to play and it was very difficult for me but I understood what the coach had to do. It is difficult for any player to not be in the team but now Iâm back in I want to keep on working hard to prove my worth. ""He (Arteta) spoke to me and obviously explained the reasons behind the decision. Why I should stay â but the most important thing was to remain focused and concentrate â he knew how important I was to the team, so Iâm happy to be back and to be able to help the team in every game."" Arsenal's very own Emile Smith Rowe is the latest famous face to have their say on how Arteta behaves on the touchline during games. After last Sunday's enthralling 3-1 victory over Liverpool, the Gunners boss came in for some criticism, with many pundits suggesting that Arteta was guilty of over-celebrating and letting his emotions get the better of him. Ahead of Sunday's trip to West Ham, Smith Rowe has explained what he feels sets his manager apart from other bosses in the Premier League. He told Sky Sports: ""I'd probably say his passion as well. ""Sometimes it just feels like he is on the pitch as well, I know other managers have passion as well but with him, it feels like he is the 12th man on the pitch."" Read more on Arteta's controversial celebrations. Arteta could shock fans and hand Amario Cozier-Duberry his Arsenal debut against West Ham on Sunday after being impressed by the teenager in first-team training. Cozier-Duberry is widely believed to be one of the brightest talents in the Gunners' famed Hale-End academy set-up. He is out of contract come the end of the season and has caught the eye of Borussia Dortmund, Ajax, Anderlecht, Wolves and Newcastle to name just five.

Allegri will draw level with former great Lippi in Juveâs all-time list and behind only Giovanni Trapattoni, who was head coach for 454 matches between 1976 and 1986. Juve will cut the gap on Serie A leaders Inter Milan to four points with victory and Allegri acknowledged it will be a special occasion for him. Massimiliano Allegri is in his second spell as head coach of Juventus  The 56-year-old told a press conference: âIâm very proud to hit 405 games in charge of Juventus, especially because it puts me level with a coach like Lippi, someone who wrote history and someone whom I have a lot of affection for.â Allegri has guided Juve to five Serie A titles and two Champions League finals â they lost both â during his two spells as head coach. Lippi also won five domestic titles in two separate stints in charge and was a Champions League winner with the club in 1996. He also led them to three other Champions League finals. Allegri is hoping his current side can consolidate their place in the top four by returning to winning ways against Udinese after last weekâs 1-0 defeat at Inter, who extended their lead at the top by winning 4-2 at Roma on Saturday.

We need to pull further clear of fifth place and go within four points of first. âWe have no shortage of motivation. We want to get back into the Champions League and on Monday, even if itâs not decisive, it is a very important game. Mentally weâre in good shape.â Udinese have taken just two points from their last five league games and sit above the relegation zone only on goal difference. Carlos Alcaraz, centre, joined Juve on loan from Southampton earlier this month  Their solitary win on the road this season was against AC Milan in November. Allegri said: âUdinese donât deserve to be where they are in the table. Theyâve dropped a lot of points late on in matches, but they have excellent players. Theyâre physical and they deserve respect.â Juveâs new signing Carlos Alcaraz made his debut as a late substitute at Inter last week and is hoping to feature again following his loan move from Southampton earlier this month. Allegri added: âAlcaraz has a lot of quality and the potential to improve. Heâs put himself at our disposal,Â but heâs not ready to start.â","Allegri added: âAlcaraz has a lot of quality and the potential to improve.

252,Hamoud dead at 39 - former Norway player suffers cardiac arrest on his FIRST DAY,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hamoud-dead-at-39---former-Norway-player-suffers-cardiac-arrest-on-his-FIRST-DAY/3300901,13 Feb,"A former Norway player has passed away at the age of 39 following a cardiac arrest.  Mounir Hamoud retired in 2019 after a 15-year career as a professional in his homeland, starring for the likes of Lyn, Bodo/Glimt and Stromsgodset. He was also capped 15 times by his country at youth level, playing seven times for the under 21 side, though never for the Norway senior team. Keen to stay in football post-retirement, Hamoud had picked up a job as an 'elite player developer' with former side Stromsgodset having worked as a circuit manager for player development in NFF Buskerud for the last four years. He died on what was due to be his first day working with the Eliteserien side, who paid tribute to the former defender on their club website.   'Stromsgodset and NFF Buskerud share this information in consultation with the next of kin,' the statement began. 'This is a brutal and shocking message to receive - it affects all of us in Stromsgodset, it affects Drammen and the entire football family. Our thoughts go primarily to Mounir's family and survivors in a very difficult situation. They have lost a father, husband, brother, son and dear family member. 'Mounir has worked as circuit manager for player development in NFF Buskerud for the past four years, and was supposed to have his very first day of work as a new top player developer in Stromsgodset today. In Mounir, we have lost a truly unique fellow human being. He was friendly, generous, inclusive and positive. He was professionally skilled and inspiring. Someone who cared and participated. Someone we were all looking forward to meeting, someone we all have only good and warm feelings for. The statement later continued: 'First and foremost, Mounir has left deep traces everywhere he has traveled. As a player and team-mate, as a coach, player developer and professional. As a colleague and fellow human being. 'Stromsgodset is in mourning. Mounir Hamoud will be deeply missed. 'More information about the funeral and commemoration will come at a later date.'  After six seasons with Bodo/Glimt, Hamoud joined Stromsgodset in 2012, playing for the club for eight years in what was one of their most successful seasons. He became a vital player of the team that won the 2013 Tippelgaen, also finishing second in 2012 and fourth in 2014. He was released at the end of the 2013-14 season, but rejoined the side in the winter of 2015.","He was released at the end of the 2013-14 season, but rejoined the side in the winter of 2015."

Morata was forced off at half time in Atletico Madridâs 1-0 La Liga loss away at rivals Sevilla due to a knee issue. The Spanish international was helped off the pitch at the interval by the Atletico Madrid physios and Simeone opted against bringing him back for the second period. Alarm bells rang for Atletico Madrid fans with Morata in tears on the bench as Simeoneâs visitors eventually lost out on the road in Andalucia.  Simeone was asked about Morataâs injury situation in his post match interview and the Argentinian coach confirmed tests tomorrow will offer a clearer picture. He added the club medics are hopeful it is not a serious injury for the experienced striker ahead of a key run of games.

The two clubs meet in the first-leg of their Champions League round 16 tie tomorrow night. Sarri said: âIf we start from the assumption that it will be impossible, we are already defeated. We don't have to think like this, but have enthusiasm and confidence: it's a good game to win. ""We'll try at all costs, with a lot of cheek. When there is suffering, we must all do it together. Tomorrow there will be difficult moments, we have to overcome them. It's inevitable when you face teams like Bayern. We have to do the opposite of what we did with Inter in the Super Cup. âThere are always difficult aspects in jobs. We must not forget that we are playing a game and we must have fun. It doesn't mean being superficial though, otherwise you won't have fun. ""If the child who has started playing football is turned off, the adult has less fun and performs less. We must not forget that we are privileged, we would probably have played football for free."" On Bayern, he added: âI expect a strong team. These teams may make some mistakes in the league, but they don't make mistakes in the Champions League. Years ago I had to prepare for a match with Real Madrid and I started watching the league matches and I had a feeling.

255,Liverpool fans believe Klopp mocked Arsenal boss Arteta with his celebrations,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Liverpool-fans-believe-Klopp-mocked-Arsenal-boss-Arteta-with-his-celebrations/3298912,11 Feb,"Liverpool fans believe that manager Jurgen Klopp mocked Arsenal with his celebrations after his team's victory over Burnley.  Klopp's side bounced back from their 3-1 defeat to Arsenal as they beat Burnley by the same scoreline. The Liverpool boss usually fist-pumps towards the Kop in celebration at the full-time whistle but on this occasion he elected to perform fist pumps to three sides of Anfield. Liverpool fans were quick to suggest that Klopp's antics were in response to Arsenal's celebrations following last weekend's game at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal boss MIkel Arteta couldn't hide his delight at the final whistle, while captain Martin Odegaard took a picture of the club's photographer Stuart MacFarlane.  One Liverpool fan joked that Arteta will imitate Klopp. They wrote: 'Arteta will do it to 4 sides at the Emirates next.' Another wrote: 'Hahahahaha heâs taking the p*** here'. Meanwhile, another added: 'That's how you do proper Fist Pumps, Arteta'. Another Liverpool fan was delighted with Klopp's celebrations and wrote: 'cc Arsenal fans you will never know what the real thing feels like'.     On Saturday, Liverpool took the lead through Diogo Jota. Burnley equalised courtesy of Dara O'Shea but Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez found the net to ensure that Klopp's side prevailed. Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones accused Arsenal of stealing his team's celebrations. 'The gaffer, the way he fist pumps the crowd, thatâs kind of our thing,' Jones told the BBC when asked Arsenal's celebrations. 'If they want to be stealing our stuff, it shows weâre on the right path if theyâre copying us. They can have their moment and stuff, but thereâs a long way to go.' Sky Sports pundit and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher was also heavily critical of Arsenal's celebrations. After Odegaard celebrated with the club photographer, Carragher said: 'Just get down the tunnel. You've won a game, three points, you've been brilliant. Back in the title race, get down the tunnel. I'm serious, honestly.' ",

Speaking to the Spanish publication, the Brazil international appeared enthused about the potential prospect of playing with the France captain at the Santiago BernabÃ©u: âI would love for him to come here. I always want to play with the best players and he is one of the best in the world.â Despite being enthusiastic about the potential of Kylian MbappÃ© signing for Madrid, Rodrygo aired on the side of caution: âI would love to play with him, but I canât talk too much about him. Heâs a PSG player and I have to respect thatâ. The final decision of MbappÃ© is yet to be confirmed but signs do seem to indicate that he will end up in the famous white shirt of Real Madrid before too long.

Despite having Gavi, Pedri, Ilkay Gundogan, Fermin Lopez and Frenkie de Jong all contracted to the club for next season, MD say that they want to bring in another central midfielder â perhaps suggesting that one of the aforementioned could be moved on. Although Aleix Garcia declared he has not had any contact with Barcelona, the Girona captain is the desired target for Blaugrana. The 26-year-old has a â¬20m release clause, but Barcelona will hope to do a deal for â¬14-15m. One of the advantages of Garcia is that he can play further forward in midfield, but as he has shown this season, is excellent at the base of the play too. Ultimately, Deco and Joan Laporta have decided that they are lacking defensive and physical prowess in front of the back four, something they will try to sign as a matter of priority. The top target appears to be Evertonâs Amadou Onana, but with Deco reportedly setting a limit of â¬40m for his transfer, but there has been talk of the likes of Chelsea and Arsenal making a â¬60m for him this summer. Almeriaâs Dion Lopy has a â¬40m release clause, but the Catalans believe he could be available for less this summer, especially with the Andalusian side staring relegation in the face.","Almeriaâs Dion Lopy has a â¬40m release clause, but the Catalans believe he could be available for less this summer, especially with the Andalusian side staring relegation in the face."
258,Jamie Carragher labels Bayern as a 'team of individuals' after 1-0 loss at Lazio,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Jamie-Carragher-labels-Bayern-as-a-team-of-individuals-after-1-0-loss-at-Lazio/3302066,1 day ago,"Jamie Carragher has slammed Bayern Munich for playing like a 'team of individuals' - and thinks their chances of winning the Champions League have been slashed.  The Liverpool legend gave a damning verdict after watching Bayern slump to a 1-0 loss at Lazio in the last 16 of the Champions League. Bayern had 16 shots but struggled to carve open a strong-willed Lazio and conceded a penalty by Ciro Immobile after Dayot Upamecano fouled Gustav Isaksen. Asked if the performance and result affect their chances of going on to win the competition, Carragher told CBS Sports: 'I think it does.' He added: 'I said before the game, Bayern Munich, for me, are a team of individuals, not a team right now.  'You see the face of the manager, Thomas Tuchel, he's going to be under huge pressure. 'And on the back of what happened against Bayer Leverkusen, really poor performance. We saw the same again. 'They missed chances, that man [Kane], in the first half, should've put Bayern Munich in front. 'But a Bayern Munich team in the Champions League don't have a shot on target for the first time in five years in a game, any game. Shows how poor it was, really. 'I still think it's probably a 50-50 game right now, you'd still expect Bayern Munich to win the game at home, but the fact Lazio have got the advantage means it's all to play for.' While a 1-0 loss means Bayern are still well in the tie, especially with the second leg being in front of their faithful at the Allianz Arena, Wednesday night left a sour taste in the mouth. Bayern were coming off a humiliating 3-0 defeat at the hands of title rivals Bayer Leverkusen and needed to respond with a statement victory. They failed to do so and that cranks up the pressure on manager Thomas Tuchel, who could become the first Bayern manager since since 2012 not to deliver a Bundesliga title. If you're going to do that, you need to compensate with outstanding success elsewhere, and a Champions League last 16 exit would not constitute much cause for joy.","If you're going to do that, you need to compensate with outstanding success elsewhere, and a Champions League last 16 exit would not constitute much cause for joy."

Gallagher put the visitors 2-1 up with his second goal of the match before Fernandez sealed the win as Chelsea rallied to secure the points that took them up to 10th in the standings. It was a tale of two halves for the Blues who went into the break a goal down after a superb Jefferson Lerma strike before Gallagher fired home to equalise in the 47th minute. Monday's result was Chelsea's 13th consecutive win against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, a club record. Mail Sport's Kieran Gill takes a look at some of the things you may have missed. Chelsea wanted Matheus Franca last summer but it is believed their intention to send him away on an immediate loan to one of their affiliate clubs was not enticing enough for the 19-year-old Brazilian. Instead, he signed for Crystal Palace in a Â£26million move from Flamengo, with his contract even containing a Ballon dâOr nominee clause. Starting on the left wing, Franca and his team-mates did their best to torment Chelsea right back Malo Gusto, who struggled who struggled in the first half but went on to assist Conor Gallagherâs equaliser. It was not until the 45th minute not until the 45th minute of this match that Chelsea had a shot of any description, Conor Gallagher dragging an attempt wide. At least Chelsea Women showed Crystal Palace they know how to attack in their FA Cup fifth-round tie on Sunday with 13 attempts. Mayra Ramirez scored the winner â an outrageous flicked finish from a cross â as she got her first goal since Chelsea smashed the world-record fee for a female footballer three weeks ago. The Colombian, 24, cost Â£384,000 plus Â£42,600 in add-ons when bought from Levante. Chelsea are top of the Womenâs Super League. The less said about how the menâs season has been, the better. Good choice from the Selhurst Park DJ as we waited for the refereeing team to solve their technical issues so the second half could start. The silence was broken when Bob Marley's Three Little Birds suddenly started to play Petr Cech's surprise appearance on Sky Sportsâ Monday Night Football coincided with his interview dropping on Jake Humphreyâs High Performance Podcast, teased as: âWhy I left Chelsea.â Cechâs sudden media presence means we can only assume whatever non-disclosure agreement he had with Chelsea has expired, with it now 19 months since he left the club as a technical advisor. Cech spent last week on loan with Belfast Giants ice hockey team, though the Premier League great will return to the Oxford City Stars. There was no shortage of banners from Crystal Palaceâs frustrated fans. âWeak club culture and direction,â read one. âSupporters ignored and taken for granted,â another. âWeak transfer policy. Youth scapegoated,â a third. Passions can run high at Selhurst Park. Even one steward stood next to the media seats was singing at the top of his voice. Sometimes, the good work of fan groups can go unnoticed, but one initiative being organised by the Chelsea Supportersâ Trust is worthy of column inches. The CST are arranging so that up to 200 fans will be allowed to sleep under Stamford Bridgeâs East Stand next month. Not in a plush bed with pillows, but in a sleeping bag on top of a flattened cardboard box. The hope is to raise tens of thousands to combat homelessness and support vulnerable and disabled veterans so they can lead fulfilling lives. The proceeds from this âBig Stamford Bridge Sleep Outâ on March 23 will go to charities Stoll and Barons Court Project. The beauty of Chelseaâs academy being based at the same training ground as the first team â unlike other Premier League clubs such as West Ham â is that it encourages a good working relationship between the two. Ahead of this match, it is understood Charlie Holland, 14, and Rio Ngumoha, 15, trained alongside Raheem Sterling and Co under Mauricio Pochettino.

The France striker's long-term future is once again a topic of debate as he enters the final year of his contract at the Parc des Princes. Real Madrid are hopeful of convincing the World Cup winner to swap Paris for the Bernabeu, but it remains to be seen if their interest will materialise into a deal following the player's decision to back out of a move back in 2022. A Premier League switch has also been touted and it's known that he has held talks with Liverpool in the past. However, speculation that a move to Arsenal would be of interest to Mbappe has surfaced this week. According to The Independent, Mbappe would be 'willing' to join the Gunners as it would present him with the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Thierry Henry. Arsenal pursued Mbappe before his blockbuster switch to PSG back in 2017; it was reported at the time that the Gunners had seen a â¬100million (Â£87m) bid for the striker knocked back by his former club, Monaco. Wenger still met with Mbappe, though - and the iconic Frenchman managed to leave a lasting impression on the global superstar, even if he did end up moving elsewhere. In a previous interview with The Telegraph, Mbappe explained: ""Yes, I met with Arsene Wenger, who is a great coach. He has a great reputation here in France, he's well-respected and knows how to develop young players. This was a real option for me. ""But, of course, Paris Saint-Germain was the main option. We weighed up the advantages and disadvantages of all the clubs but my family told me it had to be my decision and one I needed to make. It also had to be a long-term decision. So it was up to me and I decided to come here in order to develop."" Although Mbappe has yet to respond to a contract offer from Real Madrid, it's been outlined that executives at PSG expect their star man to join the Spanish giants. He had been on the cusp of joining Los Blancos back in the summer of 2022 but changed his mind on a transfer at the eleventh hour and instead signed a new contract with PSG.",He had been on the cusp of joining Los Blancos back in the summer of 2022 but changed his mind on a transfer at the eleventh hour and instead signed a new contract with PSG.
261,Real Madrid eclipse City in top European football income ranking for 22/23,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Madrid-eclipse-City-in-top-European-football-income-ranking-for-2223/3302237,1 day ago,"A UEFA report shows that the Santiago Bernabeu side generated the highest level of all European clubs for the 2022-2023 season.  After the recent Deloitte financial report on football, now itâs UEFAâs turn to reaffirm Real Madridâs financial clout in the European club panorama. The European Club Finance and Investment Landscape Report report published by the governing body on Thursday shows the Spanish side having generated the highest level of income in European football for the 2022-2023 season. UEFA estimates Madridâs income last season to be at â¬841 million with the LaLiga side edging out second placed Manchester City with only two other teams exceeding 800 million in revenue: they are BarÃ§a (â¬815 million) and PSG (â¬807 million). In total, the 132 clubs analyzed by UEFA saw their income grow by 13% with the Premier League leading the way with the likes of Manchester United, Tottenham, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Newcastle, West Ham and Brighton, in addition to City all appearing in lofty positions in the report. The power of the English competition is evident with total income as a league, estimated in this case at 6.5 billion euros. A volume of business that equals what LaLiga (â¬3,300 M) and the Bundesliga (â¬3,200 M) jointly generate. The value of audiovisual rights are instrumental in making a difference with 18 of the 20 clubs that earned the most of television are from the Premier League and only Real Madrid and BarÃ§a disrupt this dominance. The UEFA report also highlights Real Madridâs efforts to contain spending to guarantee the clubâs sustainability. Although it is first in income, the white club is fifth in the highest salaries paid listing. The club paid its players 320 million euros last season, 31% less than the previous year, in which Ancelottiâs team won the Champions League and domestic league title. The team that spends the most on salaries is PSG, with â¬529 million, followed by Barcelona (â¬505 million) and Manchester City (â¬389 million). A recent study by Deloitte (the Football Money League report prepared annually by the consulting firm) also placed Madrid as the club with the most income in European football. Its methodology, however, lowered the Bernabeu clubâs income to 831.4 million euros. Deloitte kept Manchester City second in the ranking (â¬825.9 million), but, unlike UEFA, it placed PSG in third place.","Its methodology, however, lowered the Bernabeu clubâs income to 831.4 million euros.

The French centre half could miss up to a month of action, beginning with tonightâs Premier League game away to Crystal Palace. And that could pave the way for Thiago Silva to return having been dropped by head coach Mauricio Pochettino for the midweek Villa victory. Badiashile and Axel Disasi started that Cup win and looked secure, while Silva and Pochettino reportedly held clear the air talks after the Brazilian veteranâs wife appeared to call for the manager to be sacked following the brutal loss against Wolves eight days ago. Levi Colwill is available again, while Trevoh Chalobah is fit but questions remain over his future at the club. Pochettino will meet Roy Hodgson this evening in a battle of managers under pressure and speaking ahead of the game at Selhurst Park, the former said he is not naive to the demands of the job. âIn football sometimes you win a game and people send a text congratulations and you lose a game and they want to commiserate you because I feel so sorry,â Pochettino said. ""But we are professional and we understand the situation and we know football, the experiences, and we donât need to send a text when you lose or need to win a game since a period like this. We know each other and how we need to act and behave. People know when you feel the support or not."" And he then praised Hodgson, who is teetering on the brink of being sacked by Palace following a dismal run of form. The Argentine added: â""That is part of the game, it is football. He has the experience to manage every situation. ""It will be good to see him and for sure we will share a very nice time there. From the beginning when I arrived at Southampton he was the coach of the national team and he was always there watching games and sharing time with us and we created a very good relationship. âFrom the first moment the feeling was very good between us.

Criciuma, who have just earned promotion to the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, have reportedly agreed a pre-contract with the 34-year-old French born winger, who was out of contract after the end of a short-term deal in the Championship. In 2015, he was part of the DR Congo side that finished in third place at that year's AFCON tournament, scoring against Zambia in the competition. Yannick Bolasie played 133 games for Crystal Palace between 2012 and 2016, before moving to Everton in August 2016 for a reported transfer fee of Â£25m. He has also had spells with Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough during his time in English football.  In November, he signed a short-term deal with Championship side Swansea City as a free agent after leaving Turkish side Caykur Rizespor at the end of last season. Bolasie played 12 games for the South Wales side before departing the club again at the end of January. Now it seems that he is set to head across the Atlantic for more top-flight football, this time in Brazil. Fabrizio Romano wrote on X (formerly Twitter): 'Understand Brazilian Criciuma have agreed pre-contract to sign Yannick Bolasie. 'Deal in place, waiting to check details and then time to travel to Brazil next week if all goes to plan.'  Bolasie played 50 times for the Democratic Republic of Congo, scoring nine goals, and played a key role in their third-placed finish at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, which was held in Equatorial Guinea. The journeyman winger has also spent time with Maltese side Floriana, Belgian club Anderlecht and Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon in his career, but Criciuma in Brazil would be his first club outside of Europe.","The journeyman winger has also spent time with Maltese side Floriana, Belgian club Anderlecht and Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon in his career, but Criciuma in Brazil would be his first club outside of Europe."

Granted, there have only been official records and statistics for sprint speed in the Prem since 2020/21, but itâs still pretty impressive. Micky was making up ground on Evertonâs number 11 Jack Harrison before making a superb last-ditch tackle to deny a clear shot at goal or a simple square to Dominic Calvert-Lewin. In fact, he wasnât just making up ground â he was eating that ground up. Chomp, chomp, chomp. So, Micky is quickest. But who makes up the other nine players on the Premier Leagueâs list of fastest sprinters (since 2020-21)? 10. Amadou Onana A big central midfielder has no business being on this list, really. Rangy, though, isnât he? Onana? Very rangy. Once he gets going, youâre not catching him. Clocks in at 36.65km/h versus Liverpool last October. Big man, big speed. 9. Anthony Gordon No surprise here. The Toonâs Scouse winger is absolutely rapido. All sinew. Stringy. Looks like the sort of lad who might be class at arm wrestling despite being about eight stone wet-through. Would batter you at conkers, too. Just has that look about him. 36.68km/h v Burnley last September. F*cking nyyeeooooooowwwmmmmmmmmm! 8. Brennan Johnson Another expected name on this list. Young, fast, full of beans. The Welsh golden boy knocked up 36.7km/h against Man City last season when he was still at Nottingham Forest. 7. Antonio Rudiger Perhaps a surprise inclusion here. Tony Rudiger reached a top speed of 36.72km/h back in 2021, when Chelsea played Brighton between Christmas and New Year. Donât think we could run a bath after a big Christmas dinner, let alone break some residential speed limits with our actual feet. Jesus Christ, Tony. 6. Dara OâShea What? Youâre telling us Burnley defender Dara OâShea reached the sixth-highest speed ever recorded in the Premier League just three months ago, and you didnât know about it? Call yourself a football fan? Grow up. OâShea managed a velocilicious 36.73km/h against Crystal Palace. Tell your friends. 5. Dominik Szoboszlai Another central midfielder. Whatâs he doing in here? You canât be hitting rockets from 40 yards and running really, really fast simultaneously. An enigma. Domi-quick Szoboszlai, are we right? SORRY. Please keep reading. 36.76km/h. So fast. Next. 4. Pedro Neto The lone wolf on this list, but only fourth in this particular pack at 36.86km/h versus Luton in September. NOTE TO SELF: Next time Wolves make a loan signing, refer to them as âThe Loaned Wolfâ. Thatâs the good stuff. 3. Chiedozie Ogbene Before he ran circles and squares and triangles and all other manner of shapes around Big Dan Burn last week, Ogbene racked up 36.93km/h against Fulham last September (has to be the speediest month in since records began). Heâs like lightning, is Ogbene. BDB wonât be the last left-back he embarrasses this season, mark our words. 2. Kyle Walker Obviously. 37.31km/h against Everton. 1. Micky van de Ven You already know about Micky. The fastest player in Premier League history. Youâll never sing that, youâll never sing thaaaaaaat!

They are now 3-0 up over Girona in this title showdown clash at the Santiago Bernabeu.  It has been the Vinicius Junior show in the Spanish capital. His blockbuster strike early on opened the scoring, before he laid on a world class assist for Jude Bellingham to make it 2-0 in the first half. It was more brilliant work from him for the third, as his solo effort was saved by Paulo Gazzaniga before Bellingham tapped home for his second. Thatâs 20 goals for Bellingham this season, a remarkable achievement. However, Viniciusâ contribution should not be discounted in this â he has been unplayable all evening. Real Madrid should see this one out now, while Girona will hope to bounce back from this one very quickly.","Real Madrid should see this one out now, while Girona will hope to bounce back from this one very quickly."

Rice, making his Premier League return at London Stadium for the first time since his Â£105million move, came back to haunt his former club with a sublime strike. With Mikel Arteta's title contenders leading by five goals, four of which came in a hectic 15-minute spell before half-time, Rice latched onto a loose ball from distance. His powerful strike then hurtled through the air and beat Alphonse Areola before finding the far corner, sending the travelling contingent into raptures. However, after watching several replays of the goal, some supporters took to X to claim they noticed a ball boy jump to his feet and sneakily celebrate.   'Anyone see that ball boy from behind the goal?' one asked. 'Even he was impressed.' 'Even the ball boy jumped up and celebrated,' added another. A third posted: 'Loooool even the West Ham ball boy got up and celebrated that.' 'Not that ball boy thinking DR [Declan Rice] still plays for the Hammers,' a fourth said. Several clips of the goal did indeed show the ball boy in question rising to his feet and seemingly appearing shocked, but there was no discernible celebration.      Ultimately, Rice enjoyed the last laugh and was spotted enjoying a moment on the Arsenal bench after being taken off shortly after finding the back of the net. William Saliba, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Magalhaes and Leandro Trossard all scored in the first-half, triggering hordes of West Ham supporters to head for the exits. Saka then chalked up his brace after the restart before Rice completed the rout. Though he refrained from expressing his emotions on the pitch, Rice couldn't help but crack a smile as he chatted Saka and Ben White through his explosive goal.

268,15-year-old La Masia sensation backed to make Barcelona forget about Bergvall,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/15-year-old-La-Masia-sensation-backed-to-make-Barcelona-forget-about-Bergvall/3299755,11 Feb,"Barcelona had looked in pole position to sign Lucas Bergvall, before a late swoop from Tottenham Hotspur saw the 18-year-old midfielder head for the Premier League instead. While the Catalan giants were disappointed, they remain convinced that they already have plenty of quality in the attacking midfield department in La Masia.  One of the brightest players in the academy in Guille Fernandez, who operates in a similar role to Bergvall. Aged just 15, he is already setting things alight, and that included scoring four times for Spainâs U17 side against Germany on Saturday. As per Sport, Guille is regarded within La Masia as being the next youngster to make the step up to the Barcelona first team, joining the likes of Lamine Yamal, Hector Fort and Pau Cubarsi, who are already current members despite all being aged 17 or under. Guille has already made his debut for Barcelonaâs U19 side this season, playing in the UEFA Youth League. If he continues on this current trajectory, he could even be called up to the first team by the end of the season, although itâs important that he isnât rushed to this level.","Guille has already made his debut for Barcelonaâs U19 side this season, playing in the UEFA Youth League.

269,"Barcelona 3-3 Granada: Yamal nets brace to salvage point for Barca, Lewy scores",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-3-3-Granada-Yamal-nets-brace-to-salvage-point-for-Barca-Lewy-scores/3299694,12 Feb,"Game is over and the final score is Barcelona 3-3 Granada. Here is the match report.  Barcelona are a broken team being held together by a spindly 16-year-old winger who is currently performing head and shoulders above all of his team-mates.  When Xavi finally leaves this summer â if he lasts that long on the BarÃ§a bench â the only plus of his second full season will be that he has been prepared to start and finish games with Lamal Yamal. The teenager got his teamâs first and third in this 3-3 draw against lowly Granada. He dragged his wreckage of a team to a point but thatâs nowhere near enough for them to put any sort of pressure on leaders Real Madrid. On the bright side itâs a point gained on second-placed Girona who were beaten 24-hours before. Barcelona need to finish second in the league to qualify for next seasonâs Spanish Super Cup. And they need a strong Champions League run â neither look too likely playing this way. They had little to offer in the first half apart from their boy-wonder winger and he was enough to give them the lead on 14-minutes.   Ilkay Gundogan, Pedri and Joao Cancelo built an attack down the left. It broke down when the ball reached Robert Lewandowski and he wandered into traffic and lost it. But it came back out to Pedri and his curling cross to the back post was turned in by Yamal. The teenager had threatened moments before crossing from the right with no one to connect with his dangerous centre. BarÃ§a did not build on the lead and with goalkeeper Marc Andre ter Stegen not inspiring much confidence at the back there was always a chance they would concede an equalizer. The German keeper has been out for almost three months and since his last game in November Barcelona have let in 28 goals in 15 games. His return could not prevent strugglers Granada scoring. It was Manchester United loanee Facundo Pellistri who made the goal getting away from Pedri down the Granada and crossing for Ricard Sanchez to score. The run was a good one although Pedri provided little resistance. But it was the intelligence of the pull-back and the pace with which it was played that made the goal. Ricard just had to make a clean contact and guide it with precision. He did that, leaving Ter Stegen well beaten in the top corner of his near post. Lewandowski might have put Barcelona back into the lead but his shot from Gundoganâs cross was blocked on the line by Martin Hongla. Granada signed 10 players in January in an attempt to save themselves and Xavi came into the game with the record of never having beaten them as coach. But they are second for bottom and Barcelonaâs pedestrian, disjointed first half performance earned them whistles on the half-time whistle. At the restart Lewandoski had Barcelonaâs first chance from Gundoganâs pass but he blazed over. And it was not long before Granada were on the attack with Pellistri sent over the top on to a long pass from Ricard. He tried to beat Ter Stegen at his near post but this time the keeper saved with his face. It was Pellistri who put Granada in front. Pau Cubarsiâs header dropped short to Myrto Uzuni and when he crossed it was the Uruguayan winger who turned the ball in at the back post with IÃ±igo Martinez and Cancelo both spectators.   The lead only lasted three minutes because Cancelo crossed from the left to Gundogan and he slipped Lewandowski through to fire past Augusto Batalla and put Barcelona back level. Surely Barcelona now would go on to win the game. Wrong. Granada went 3-2 up from their next chance when Faitout Maouassa crossed and Ignasi Miquel headed in his teamâs third. He came through the Barcelona youth team before moving to Arsenal. Now 31-years-old the centre-back had scored against their awful defence. Barcelona were back level again when Yamal got his teamâs third and the gameâs sixth goal. Unlike the first goal he scored there was no clever build-up. He just lashed into bottom left corner of Augusto Batallaâs goal from the edge of the area. He barely celebrated. He knows itâs not good enough to draw with lowly Granada. And his next trick was to almost set-up BarÃ§aâs fourth. He drifted into space down the right and with the outside of his left boot crossed to Gundogan who couldnât beat Batalla. Granada held on for the point and maybe deserved more. Xavi can point to the fact that the savior of his team is there because he has believed in him. His critics will remind him that without Yamal BarÃ§a have nothing else. 0' The match is about to start!  8' CLOSE!

270,Chelsea 'make offer for Brighton's head of recruitment and son of ex-PL manager',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-make-offer-for-Brightons-head-of-recruitment-and-son-of-ex-PL-manager/3302155,1 day ago,"Chelsea have reportedly made an offer to Brighton for their head of recruitment Sam Jewell - just 16 months after poaching his predecessor Paul Winstanley.  Back in November 2022, the Blues swooped in and appointed Winstanley as their Director of Global Talent and Transfers, after an eight year spell in Sussex. However, now, the west London giants are keen on bringing Jewell - son of former Premier League manager Paul Jewell - to Stamford Bridge. According to The Telegraph, the Blues have offered Jewell a global scouting role in charge of negotiations for both the London club and Strasbourg in Ligue 1. The outlet further claim that Chelsea's desire to get a deal over the line stems from concerns that Dan Ashworth may take Jewell with him to Manchester United.  Ashworth - who is currently the sporting director at Newcastle - is expected to reach an agreement next week to take up the same role at Old Trafford, following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival. According to ESPN, Ashworth will be given the responsibility of rebuilding United's scouting department, with Jewell identified as the leading candidate to head up the new structure, hence why the Blues are keen to act swiftly in their negotiations. It's reported that no final decision has been made by Jewell yet, who is also open to staying at Brighton. Jewell joined the Seagulls in 2016 after taking on the rule as the club's Under-21s recruitment head. The 34-year-old then moved up to emerging talent scouting manager in 2018 and has been head of recruitment for 14 months, since Winstanley's departure. Winstanley became the sixth staff member to follow Graham Potter from Brighton to Stamford Bridge after Potter was appointed Blues boss back in 2022. After Potter's arrival, Chelsea brought in first-team coaches Billy Reid, Bjorn Hamberg and Bruno Saltor, goalkeeping coach Ben Roberts and recruitment analyst Kyle Macaulay from Brighton - which made Winstanley the sixth to make the move.   Currently, only Roberts remains at the club after Potter and the rest of his backroom staff were dismissed from their roles back in April 2023. Speaking to Brighton's club website last summer, Jewell reflected on Winstanley's departure and praised the forward planning at the seaside club. 'Departures are part and parcel of football,' Jewell said in June last year, 'and while it was sad to see two really good people leave us, it has opened doors to others, including me. 'Following Paul's departure, I took on the head of recruitment role on an interim basis and it was very much business as usual.'","'Following Paul's departure, I took on the head of recruitment role on an interim basis and it was very much business as usual.'"

The veteran Premier League manager was set to speak to the media at 1.30pm today as the club prepare to call time on his second stint in charge. Mail Sport revealed earlier that Palace decision-makers will bring an end to Hodgson's second spell at Selhurst Park amid a concerning run of form. However, the club have revealed that he was taken ill during the morning's training session and is now unable to attend the usual press conference with the media. The media sit-down was scheduled to take place at 1.30pm, with Palace providing the update on Hodgson's condition just 35 minutes beforehand. Providing a short update, Palace posted on their X profile: 'Unfortunately, todayâs press conference will no longer take place as scheduled as Roy Hodgson was taken ill during this morningâs training session.' There has been no further communication on what has happened to Hodgson or if he will be fit to take charge of Palace for their upcoming trip to Goodison Park. Concerningly, this is the second time in a matter of months that Hodgson has suffered ill health after he previously missed Palace's 3-1 defeat against Aston Villa on September 16. That occasion led to Hodgson withdrawing from his matchday duties after struggling on the morning of the game as he took time off to recover. Assistants Paddy McCarthy and Ray Lewington oversaw the game in his absence and could do so again if Hodgson is unwell to return in time for Monday. The former England manager recovered quickly from his health scare on that occasion to take his place back in the dugout for Palace's following match versus Fulham. Hodgson is currently the Premier League's oldest manager and looked to have retired from management permanently in 2022 following an unsuccessful short-term spell at Watford. However, was brought back to Selhurst Park for a second tenure and tasked with rescuing Palace from relegation as Patrick Vieira was sacked from his first Premier League role.","However, was brought back to Selhurst Park for a second tenure and tasked with rescuing Palace from relegation as Patrick Vieira was sacked from his first Premier League role."

Kavanagh will officiate the game at Wembley on February 25, but his appointment may not be too popular with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. Mark Scholes and James Mainwaring will be the assistant referees, with Tim Robinson named as the fourth official and John Brooks overseeing VAR. Klopp was livid when Kavanagh failed to award Liverpool a penalty during their 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Anfield on December 23. The Liverpool boss was adamant that his side should have been awarded a penalty for a handball from Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard.   After the game, Klopp said: 'The penalty situation is a weird situation, I don't know if the ref can see it, but you look at it and I'm not sure how you can say it's not a penalty.' Klopp was also critical of Kavanagh in his post-match press conference. He said: 'I didn't see it in the game, I saw it after and I think we all agree it was handball. But I always wait until Mr Dermot (Gallagher) explains it the next day (in his role as a TV analyst) what's really the case. 'He will find a way to explain to me why it was not handball. For me it's a clear handball. I have no idea if it would have influenced the result.' In February 2021, Klopp was angry after Kavanagh gave Everton a penalty against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby. The incident related to Trent Alexander-Arnold fouling Dominic Calvert-Lewin the area. Gylfi Sigurdsson scored from the spot, with Everton proceeding to win 2-0. Klopp said after the game: 'I really think it is unfair to ask me because everybody asks me that question, so it means everybody thinks it was not a penalty. But that is not really important because the referee thought it was a penalty. 'So I wanted to talk to him after the first few interviews I had but he left already. I just wanted to ask what did he see because when the VAR calls you over to the sideline then I think he is in doubt about the decision. 'But he needed only a second (to decide). So he went there, had a look and give a penalty, so he obviously saw something other people didn't see. I haven't seen it back yet but everyone who speaks to me tells me the same. How can it be a penalty?'.   Furthermore, in December 2021, Klopp was angry after Andy Robertson was sent off in a 2-2 draw against Tottenham. Kavanagh was on VAR duty for the game, with Liverpool also feeling that then-Tottenham striker Harry Kane should have been sent off. After the game Klopp commented on Robertson red card as he said: 'It's a clear, absolutely 100 per cent a red card,' Klopp said about Robertson's dismissal. 'If Andy Robertson's foot is on the ground his leg is broken. Luckily for both it was in the air, but it's still a red card. The ref saw it differently.' Klopp was also hugely critical of Kavanagh's performance as VAR. Klopp said: 'We saw it back and yes you can give a red card there [for Kane]. It's not the harshest ever but not the smartest as well and he knows that. 'He lost it a little bit. This red card you can give but this was proof that VAR was there today because before that we thought he might not be in his office. I think we all agree that Harry Kane should have seen a red card, and he didn't.'","'He lost it a little bit.

274,Hojlund finally works out problem after being told to confront Man Utd team-mate,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hojlund-finally-works-out-problem-after-being-told-to-confront-Man-Utd-team-mate/3302157,1 day ago,"At long last, Rasmus Hojlund is now finding the back of the net at a regular rate for Manchester United - though he is still having to rely on his own instincts.  In an ideal world for the Old Trafford faithful, Hojlund would be reaping the benefits of being flanked by the likes of Antony, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho. Much has been made of how United's attack link-up with their Danish striker, given his Â£72million fee this summer has placed plenty of pressure on the ex-Atalanta man. Currently, Hojlund has managed five goals in his last five league games. Not one of them has been assisted by the aforementioned trio of fellow forwards, which suggests that concerns first raised by pundits before the turn of the year are still lingering. Ex-United assistant coach Rene Meulensteen took aim at both Antony and Garnacho while analysing Hojlund's lack of league goals before Christmas. The Dutchman used the Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich as an example of his argument that neither have any intention to link up with the centre-forward. ""I thought he [Hojlund] was way short [against Bayern]. Against those defenders, he never got a kick,"" Meulensteen told talkSPORT. ""But the problem is he is flanked by two individual players [Antony and Garnacho] who have no intention to give him any kind of service because they want to create things for themselves and not help any striker. ""So thereâs an imbalance, and that imbalance is going forward but also going back in terms of the defensive shape which weâve seen in so many games."" His sentiments were echoed by pundit Chris Sutton, who also singled out Antony as a reason behind Hojlund's early season struggles. ""I don't want to keep going back to Manchester United, but we watched Hojlund the other night, I felt really sorry for him,"" Sutton explained to Mail Sport's  It's All Kicking Off  podcast. ""I feel really sorry for him. He looks like a player that is a little bit low on confidence now, but I don't think that he has an understanding of how he can score a goal at Manchester United because the wide players want the ball for themselves. Antony, the other night, never got his head up. Pass, follow, link-up â there aren't combinations. And that's a massive issue."" It wasn't just Hojlund's fellow attackers that came in for scrutiny. He was encouraged by Ian Wright to confront right-back Diogo Dalot for poor service during December's 3-0 home defeat by Bournemouth. The Arsenal legend even accused Dalot of lacking respect for United's new striker. That doesn't seem to be an issue anymore, with Hojlund hitting a rich vein of form at an ideal time as United look to garner some momentum for their Champions League qualification push. If he can prolong this purple patch, the 21-year-old's debut season can be deemed a success.","That doesn't seem to be an issue anymore, with Hojlund hitting a rich vein of form at an ideal time as United look to garner some momentum for their Champions League qualification push.

275,Varane confronts Douglas Luiz following Scott McTominay's late Man United winner,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Varane-confronts-Douglas-Luiz-following-Scott-McTominays-late-Man-United-winner/3300763,12 Feb,"Raphael Varane appeared to get the last laugh on Douglas Luiz after confronting the Brazilian following Manchester United's late winner against Aston Villa.  Scott McTominay netted in the 86th minute at Villa Park, as United moved just five points behind their opponents with a victory. Aston Villa looked as though they would be taking a point from the contest, after Luiz netted an equaliser from close range with just over 20 minutes to play. Luiz after his goal did a shimmy celebration, which happened to be directly in front of United defender Varane who did not look best pleased with his antics. While most of United's players celebrated in front of their travelling support after McTominay headed in their late winner, Varane walked over to confront Luiz.  The Frenchman with his arms stretched out walked over to Luiz as the Brazilian picked up the ball, and the pair appeared to exchange words and get in each other's faces. Referee Robert Jones saw the confrontation and got between them to stop the row. Meanwhile, another image appeared to show Diogo Dalot mocking Luiz with his own shimmy as he celebrated in front of United's fans. Luiz's celebration appeared to backfire on both himself and the team, as Villa suffered their third consecutive home defeat. Man United boss Erik ten Hag, suggested after the game that the Brazilian's shimmy of the shoulders may have 'fuelised' (fuelled) his players. Club legend Rio Ferdinand also poked fun at the Villa man on social media afterwards, posting a photo of Luiz doing the shimmy with the caption: 'U ok?' Varane was not the only player that Luiz had a row with during the 90 minutes. Rasmus Hojlund, who scored the opening goal of the match, took his time to get off the pitch as he was replaced by Jonny Evans.    This infuriated Aston Villa's fans and coaching staff, though Hojliund in response offered a cheeky gesture by reminding them of the score and signalling that they should simmer down. Clearly unhappy with both the gesture, and the clock running down as he meandered off the field of the play, Luiz ran over to him and grabbed his shirt before ushering the forward off. Villa fans made their feelings clear throughout the incident, with clips on social media demonstrating just how much Hojlund had infuriated some of the supporters in attendance. United would have the last laugh though, as they held out to secure three points, which could be crucial come end of the season.","United would have the last laugh though, as they held out to secure three points, which could be crucial come end of the season."
276,Conte insists he 'does NOT regret' rant calling out Tottenham players' mentality,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Conte-insists-he-does-NOT-regret-rant-calling-out-Tottenham-players-mentality/3301711,2 days ago,"Antonio Conte has admitted he has no regrets about blasting Tottenham players in his infamous rant that eventually led to the Italian leaving the club last year.  Rewind nearly 12 months and Conte was fuming after his Spurs side blew a two-goal lead against St Mary's and draw 3-3 with Southampton who would go on to be relegated to the Championship. The former Premier League-winning-manager with Chelsea was on thin ice amidst tensions within the Spurs camp leading up to the game. The ice then cracked after his post-match rant with Conte quickly leaving the club. His outspoken honesty to the media was heavily criticised at the time as Conte called out 'selfish players' and insisted the club's long-running lack of silverware was because of Tottenham's mentality. Now, currently without a management job and spending his time relaxing in his homeland of Italy, Conte has looked back at his comments on that fateful day on the English south coast with The Telegraph.  'At that moment, my feeling was that. If I tell something, it means there is always something true,' he admitted. 'No, honestly, I don't regret anything about this. But I have good feelings about Tottenham. I keep this experience in my heart.' 'I am this way. I hate the lies. This can help me sometimes or sometimes can hurt me. But I prefer to stay in silence than to tell a good lie - also the relationship with my players,' he added. 'During the season, it can happen that you need an honest conversation that can be positive or negative. I know very well, I was a player as well and some coaches told me good lies to keep me calm. I don't want this type of situation. 'I know very well when you have these honest conversations with the players, in the first moment they can be a bit angry. Then, from my experience, the time helps the player to appreciate you. They were angry, but then they appreciate the honesty.' Conte's departure under toxic circumstances split Spurs supporters with some blaming his negative attitude for difficulties and other pointing blame at club chairman Daniel Levy. Now under the guidance of Conte's permanent successor, Ange Postecoglou, Spurs are competing for a place in next season's Champions League and playing some of the most attractive football in the Premier League.  However, despite their improvements, Spurs are again likely to end this season without silverware. They were knocked out of the Carabao Cup early in the competition and eliminated from the FA Cup by Sheffield United. Conte's comments at St Mary's explained his belief as to why the club had struggled to match the success of their English competitors, saying at the time:  'They are used to it here. 'They don't play for something important. They don't want to play under pressure. They don't want to play under stress. It is easy in this way. Tottenham's story is this. 'I said I wanted to see the fire and I have not seen it. I said that I want to see the fire in their eyes, in their hearts. I want to see the right spirit. Not only in the training session, but on the pitch because it is here you make the difference.","'I said I wanted to see the fire and I have not seen it.

277,Ronwen Williams spot-on again as South Africa clinch third place,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ronwen-Williams-spot-on-again-as-South-Africa-clinch-third-place/3299189,11 Feb,"South Africa claimed third place in the Africa Cup of Nations, beating DR Congo 6-5 in a tense penalty shoot-out after surviving a second-half onslaught during the 90 minutes. Bafana Bafana appeared second favourites in the shoot-out after Teboho Mokoena hit the post with the first spot-kick to hand DR Congo an immediate advantage and the stage was set for captain Chancel Mbemba to hit the winner, only to see his effort saved by Ronwen Williams. And Williams â who saved four penalties in the quarter-final shoot-out win over Cape Verde â was the hero again after he kept out Mischack Eliaâs penalty to seal the win. It came after a 90 minutes in which DR Congo threatened again and again, but could not find a way to beat Williams. The goalkeeper was quickly off his line to deny Silas Wamangituka, clean through on goal after eight minutes. Simon Banza appeared to be through in the 27th minute but he could not get the proper contact on his shot and it dribbled back to Williams. As half-time loomed, Elia tried to find Banza in front of goal but Siyanda Xulu made a crucial intervention to stop the danger. DR Congo remained the more dangerous of the two teams at the start of the second half. When Grady Diangana lifted a ball through for Banza he got enormous power on his hooked shot, but could not keep it down as it whistled over the crossbar. Ivory Coast AFCON Soccer  Elia tried his luck with a free-kick just before the hour, but his curling shot was straight at the goalkeeper. The pressure kept coming, and should have resulted in a goal in the 65th minute. Williams completely fluffed gathering a high ball, gifting possession to Elia. His cross was deflected but it fell to Silas, who had a glorious chance in front of goal only to drag it wide. Substitute Ricardo Goss then wasted an equally glorious chance in the 75th minute, hooking over from point-blank range as he back-pedalled, making contact off-balance. Having been under pressure for so long, South Africa had a great chance to win it with five minutes left when Mihlali Mayambela broke through the offside trap, but with team-mates better placed he tried to beat Dimitry Bertaud from a tight angle and failed. DR Congo went to the other end where substitute Fiston Mayele got away from Xulu with great control, only to drag his shot across goal from a tight angle and ensure the contest would be decided from the spot.","DR Congo went to the other end where substitute Fiston Mayele got away from Xulu with great control, only to drag his shot across goal from a tight angle and ensure the contest would be decided from the spot."

Haaland is renowned for being prolific in front of goal and the striker almost found the net with a spectacular acrobatic effort during the Champions League clash. Following a cross from substitute Jeremy Doku, Haaland showed tremendous athleticism to connect with the ball and almost came close to scoring. Fans quickly took to social media to comment on Haaland's impressive effort. One wrote: 'If this went in, this would be the wildest goal Iâve seen in years'.  One user described Haaland as being almost 'superhuman'. They wrote: 'Haaland might be the closest athlete Iâve seen to a superhuman'. Meanwhile, another user wrote: 'Imagine he scored that'. In addition, another added: 'Bro almost scored one of the best goals'. One user described Haaland's athleticism as 'freaky'. They wrote: 'His athleticism is freaky'. Haaland boasts a superb goalscoring return for City having scored 73 goals in 78 appearances for the club prior to Tuesday night's game. ",
279,Who are the players most continuously loyal to their clubs across the planet?,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Who-are-the-players-most-continuously-loyal-to-their-clubs-across-the-planet/3302076,1 day ago,"Valentine's Day is an opportunity for many to show their commitment to their loved ones - but not all footballers have the same loyalty to one club.  The modern game sees many players move away from their boyhood clubs and the locations of their youth experience to get more game time, or to move through the ranks towards the upper reaches of football. So it can be a surprise to discover the players who have the longest unbroken spell with their clubs in the top leagues across the world - with some staying in one place for more than 20 years. The CIES Football Observatory has highlighted footballers from 60 leagues across the planet who have the longest unbroken spell representing the same club. Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev has been at CSKA Moscow for 21 years, a feat which is almost unparalleled in the modern game.  In joint second place globally, Akhmat Grozny defender Rizvan Utsiev and Al-Jazira Club goalkeeper Ali Khaseif have both spent 19 years representing their respective clubs. Just below those are five players who have spent 18 years with the same club, including 36-year-old defender Lewis Stevenson who has spent half his life on the books at Scottish club Hibernian. In the big five European leagues, there are only 11 players who have spent 13 years at one club - and two Germans top the table. Thomas Muller at Bayern Munich and Tony Jantschke at Borussia Monchengladbach are currently playing their sixteenth consecutive season with their respective clubs.   The rest of the top five is made up of Spanish players, with Athletic Clubâs Iker Muniain and Oscar de Marcos, as well as Atletico Madridâs Koke Resurreccion all with 15 years of service to their teams. Everton's Seamus Coleman was the only player in the Premier League to make the top ten list, for the defender's 14 years with the Toffees. Crystal Palace defender Joel Ward, Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus and Real Madrid's Luka Modric are among those who fall just short of the top 10, with 12 years of continuous service to their respective teams.","Crystal Palace defender Joel Ward, Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus and Real Madrid's Luka Modric are among those who fall just short of the top 10, with 12 years of continuous service to their respective teams."
280,Why Erik ten Hag will be secretly supporting Manchester City in the Champions League,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Why-Erik-ten-Hag-will-be-secretly-supporting-Manchester-City-in-the-Champions-League/3301316,13 Feb,"Picture the scene. Erik ten Hag settles down in his front room with a glass of wine to cheer on Manchester City in the Champions League.  Yes, thatâs right. Ten Hag may be a Red, but heâs most-definitely in the Blue corner when it comes to the Champions League. The Premier League badly needs to boost its UEFA coefficient after Ten Hagâs Manchester United and Newcastle exited the Champions League in the knock-out round. Ten Hag needs City, and Arsenal for that matter, to go deep in the competition and boost the Premier Leagueâs hopes of getting an extra spot in next seasonâs expanded competition. That would mean fifth place in the Premier League earning the lucky recipients a coveted spot in the Champions League. This is hugely relevant to United as they battle for the top places and they are sixth, five points behind fifth-placed Aston Villa. Fourth place would guarantee Unitedâs passage back into the Champions League, but Tottenham, with all their stars back, look in no mood to give that up. The stakes could not be higher for ten Hag and his future as United boss is riding on this. Finish outside the Champions League places, and he will almost certainly be sacked, as was the case with his compatriot Louis van Gaal, who suffered the indignity of finding out Jose Mourinho was replacing him in the hours after winning the FA Cup in 2016. Finish in them, and Ten Hag might have done enough to persuade Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he is turning around the supertanker that is Manchester United. United are coming with a flourish and they are unbeaten in 2024, winning four of their last five games. They have won their last three Premier League games in impressive style, overtaking West Ham and closing in on Villa in the Champions League race. Ten Hag finally has momentum for the first time since lifting the Carabao Cup last season and United appear in the mood to do something this season. Ten Hag has luck on his side, which should never be underestimated, and any other manager would surely have been sacked in December when United exited not only the Champions League, but Europe. But Ratcliffe was still finalising buying his minority shareholding in United and agreeing to take over the running of all football operations. He did not need finding a new manager added to his huge to-do list, especially when United could not have got the top-quality candidate they would have wanted. United are also still scarred by the memory of Wreck-It-Ralph [Rangnick] and interim bosses when the club hit new lows as it drifted along, rudderless. Ten Hag must now convince Ratcliffe he is still the man for United when May arrives and clubs traditionally change managers. Qualifying for the Champions League would be his ace card, even more so than winning the FA Cup. All this brings fifth-place into play and if supporting City and Arsenal in the Champions League were not unpalatable enough, ten Hag could secretly root for Liverpool in the Europa League. Victory for the Merseyside Reds would also boost the Premier Leagueâs coefficient and possibly make United and ten Hag holders of the Champions Leagueâs golden ticket.",Victory for the Merseyside Reds would also boost the Premier Leagueâs coefficient and possibly make United and ten Hag holders of the Champions Leagueâs golden ticket.
281,Carragher hits out at Silva's wife for putting him in an 'awkward position',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Carragher-hits-out-at-Silvas-wife-for-putting-him-in-an-awkward-position/3301171,13 Feb,"Jamie Carragher has criticised Thiago Silva's wife for her public outburst over Mauricio Pochettino - in which she appeared to call for the Chelsea boss to be sacked.  Isabelle has regularly used her social media to outspokenly express her feelings regarding the state of her husband's club. After their recent 4-2 win over Wolves, she stated that it was 'time for change,' which appeared to suggest that the Blues should part ways with Pochettino. She has since apologised for her comments, but Carragher ahead of their clash with Crystal Palace on Monday night, said family members should not be going public about a manager. Carragher also remarked that Chelsea will have to move on from Silva, who turns 40 in September, and is out of contract this summer.   'Thiago Silva is one of the best centre-backs of his generation and heâs shown that since heâs come to Chelsea,â Carragher told Sky Sports. âBut there is a bit of pressure on him [now]. He didnât play against Aston Villa, the team had a great result and the two centre-backs played really well. âAnd he starts off the back of what was said by his wife. In terms of family members speaking, I think back to when I was a player. âWhether it be your wife, your father, your brotherâ¦ whoever it may be should not be going public about a manager. âSometimes an agent comes out and speaks about a player. That is not right and it has to stop. Itâs not the first time itâs happened. Itâs put him in an awkward position. âHeâs a fantastic footballer but there will be a few eyes on him. Sooner or later, Chelsea have to move on from Thiago Silva given the age of him.â Isabelle took to X after Chelsea's 4-2 loss to Wolves earlier this month, in which she called for Pochettino to be sacked. She posted: 'It's time to change. If you wait any longer it will be too late.'  However, she has since apologised, blaming her 'outburst' on being 'passionate' and 'saddened by defeats'. 'I'm sorry that my personal outburst as a passionate Chelsea fan has caused such an impact. I'm passionate about the team, I thrive on victories and I'm saddened by defeats,' she wrote on X. 'We all want the same thing, a winning team, come on Chelsea!!' Pochettino revealed at his press conference on Tuesday that Chelsea centre back Silva spoke to him personally after Isabelle's social media post in a bid to ensure there was no tension between the pair. The Argentine refused to discuss the nature of their conversation, describing it as a 'private' matter that was handled before training. 'He came today to talk with me,â he said. âI am not going to talk in the way we were talking. The important thing is he came and wanted to talk with me. âHe knows me after more than 10 years, who I am, we are a very strong coaching staff and the way we operate. Of course he came to talk. We talked. It was private. And that's it.â This is not the first time that Isabelle has left her husband in a potentially sticky situation.   Back in 2018 when the Brazilian defender was playing for PSG she called out manager Unai Emery, writing on Instagram: 'Tactics, tactics, tactics?' after her husband was dropped for a 3-1 Champions League defeat at Real Madrid. Two years later, she hit out at Liverpool's Andy Robertson after he shared a video of himself skinning Jorginho during a 2-0 win for the Reds in September 2020. She responded on TikTok: 'Chilwell is better than u dude you even lost to Southampton'. For good measure, more than 500,000 fans liked her comment. But it is not just opponents that she has criticised, as she also slammed Timo Werner for his finishing after he failed to find the net in Chelsea's 1-1 Champions League semi-final first leg draw with Real Madrid in 2021. 'This is karma, guys. Every team I go there is a striker who keeps missing goalsâ¦ this Werner, what is his name?',' she wrote on Instagram. In a second video she added: 'We need a goal, we need to win this match but my attackers don't want to score, I don't know why they don't score.'   She blasted Graham Potter's decision-making last season when he left her husband on the bench for a 4-0 FA Cup defeat at Manchester City, as she posted: 'I just think that going back or looking for solutions when you take a hasty and totally wrong attitude is not wrong #goblues.' Chelsea meanwhile are sweating over Thiago Silva's fitness after he lasted less than 30 minutes in their comeback 3-1 win over Crystal Palace. He stayed down after attempting to block an effort from Jean-Phillipe Mateta. He received treatment on the field, and was replaced by Levi Colwill - shaking his head as he walked off the pitch. Pochettino later confirmed the defender felt something in his groin and the Blues will hope that it's nothing serious with Manchester City and Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final to come over the next couple of weeks.",Pochettino later confirmed the defender felt something in his groin and the Blues will hope that it's nothing serious with Manchester City and Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final to come over the next couple of weeks.
282,How Ten Hag has turned Man Utd's season around: Patience paying off with Onana,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/How-Ten-Hag-has-turned-Man-Utds-season-around-Patience-paying-off-with-Onana/3301114,13 Feb,"Dropping to eighth in the Premier League after a 2-0 defeat at West Ham just before Christmas, fingers were being pointed and questions were being asked about Erik ten Hag.  United had, on that day, officially lost more games than they had won in all competitions and this was quickly turning into a season to forget. But what has followed has been a drastic turnaround which has seen United put a run together which has Rasmus Hojlund as the in-form striker in the league, Scott McTominay thriving in a new bench role, and Diogo Dalot looking a player transformed at right back. It is now United with all the momentum in the race for the top four, not Aston Villa, who they beat 2-1 on Sunday, as it was for a while. Mail Sport picks out five things Ten Hag has done to help turn United's ailing season on its head... Credit to Ten Hag for sticking with Onana when it would have been so easy to bow to fan pressure and drop the Cameroonian shot-stopper. After a disastrous 3-3 draw at Galatasaray in the Champions League in December - where Onana was blamed for all three goals - calls were deafening for Ten Hag to accept he had made a mistake signing Onana and to instead turn to Altay Bayindir or Tom Heaton. 'Players always need trust,' Ten Hag said. 'After Alisson, he is the best stopper in the league for preventing expected goals. So then you deserve to play. 'He has the potential, so we have to work on him so that he does it consistently. We will work with him and we will support him. The manager, coaches and players all support him.' Asked if he has considered dropping Onana, he replied: 'It won't help him. Nobody is undroppable, that is also clear. But we have a strong belief that he will help us win trophies.'   Now, vindication. At Aston Villa, Onana was as key to the victory as matchwinner Scott McTominay, or first goalscorer Rasmus Hojlund. Onana made eight saves in total, five of which came from inside the box. There were two point-blank saves to deny Ollie Watkins which deserved more headlines. 'We created chances but we weren't clinical,' a deflated Unai Emery said of his Villa team. 'Their goalkeeper played a fantastic match and we lost a very good opportunity.' A shot-stopper that also performs the sweeper-keeper role Ten Hag craves in his teams. With seven clean sheets - second in the league only behind Jordan Pickford at Everton - don't rule a Golden Glove out yet. No player has scored more Premier League goals since Christmas Day than Rasmus Hojlund. That's no fluke. It may seem that way to some of United's detractors, a player that has hit a purple patch and it will soon dry up. But Ten Hag has now found a front three that can get the best out of his marquee Â£72million summer signing. Alejandro Garnacho has bought into his new role playing on the right wing, while Ten Hag brilliantly handled the disciplinary issue involving Marcus Rashford missing training after a boozy night out in Belfast. He has returned to the side with a new edge. And that in turn, pure pace either side of him, has elevated Hojlund massively. United are incredibly short when it comes to centre forward - Anthony Martial is the only alternative to Hojlund and he isn't up to par - and so so much onus has been placed onto the 21-year-old's shoulders. Hojlund's goal at Villa takes him to 11 goals for the campaign and while Ten Hag has, like he did with Onana, remained patient with his young striker, his willingness to put any stubbornness aside to bench Â£86m man Antony in a bid to unlock the Dane is paying off tenfold.    Garnacho and Rashford have given United much more balance in attack, as Gary Neville put it over the weekend. But it would be remiss to overlook the huge impact on this team that the combination of Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo is having. Two players who are at very different stages of their careers - one is a five-time Champions League winner and the other is an 18-year-old Academy star - appear to have hit it off on and off the pitch. 'Casemiro is a very important player for our game, so we are happy he's back and Kobbie Mainoo can learn a lot from that togetherness,' Ten Hag ahead of facing Villa. 'Kobbie is very coachable and Casemiro has so much experience and that can even accelerate his development. When they play together, I think they can benefit each other.  'Casemiro has taken to him [Mainoo]. He's talking to him. I see it in the dressing room. I see it on the pitch. In the training, also in games. Of course he's looking at his own game, but he's trying to help and to support.' Mainoo is a real gem of a player and can play in both the No 6 and No 8 role - it was his flick to Dalot on the right flank to tee up McTominay for the winning goal at Villa. He has provided the energy that was lacking earlier in the campaign when Casemiro was alongside Sofyan Amrabat or Christian Eriksen, both of which are more methodical on the ball and possess different attributes to Mainoo. Mainoo and Casemiro is working for now but is also a sign Ten Hag is looking to the future. There are few better mentors for Mainoo than someone as accomplished as Casemiro. Rio Ferdinand was not alone in doubting whether Diogo Dalot would be able to cut it at Manchester United. 'I remember speaking to Cristiano Ronaldo and saying, ""is he really going to be any good? and he said, ""look Rio, he works hard. He'll work, he'll make himself better, he'll improve, 100%,""' Ferdinand said on his FIVE podcast. Ronaldo got to see what many people outside the club don't - Dalot works harder than most.   Of course, there are deficiencies to his game and course there remains room for improvement, but at Villa, and even more generally in recent weeks, the right back deserved his flowers. 'Everyone gets criticism but he is a fantastic player who is developing very well,' Ten Hag told Match of the Day 2. 'He can play in so many positions and he is improving on crosses.

'I feel like as long as I'm fit and healthy I can come onto the pitch and perform,' McTominay told Sky Sports. The Scot is a curious one, often deployed in a deeper role that hasn't seemed to get the best out of him, he's now emerged as a revelation from the bench to be United's top scorer in the Premier League this season. For Ten Hag, having a legitimate game-changer on the bench - something that hasn't always been a luxury available to him this season - is something to cherish. 'There are not many players who can come from the bench and bring this energy and contribute to the team,' Ten Hag said. 'Scott is an example for many other players, always giving the spirit and always doing the right things. 'He is ready for one minute or for minute 90, he is always ready. It is great to have such a player.'","'He is ready for one minute or for minute 90, he is always ready. It is great to have such a player.'"
283,Real Madrid star Toni Kroos admits he is considering Germany return for Euro 2024,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Madrid-star-Toni-Kroos-admits-he-is-considering-Germany-return-for-Euro-2024/3300912,13 Feb,"Real Madrid metronome Toni Kroos has admitted he is thinking about coming out of retirement for Germany this summer, as they look to win their first international title a decade on from securing the World Cup in Brazil on home soil. At the same time, he left the door open to retirement at the end of the season.  The 34-year-old has been receiving calls from his home country to return to die Mannschaft on account of his excellent form once again, with Germany struggling. Including from teammate Antonio Rudiger, who says that he is amongst the best they have. Asked about it ahead of their clash with RB Leipzig in the Champions League, Kroos explained that those were the two biggest decisions he had to wrestle with. âThese are all the problems I haveâ¦ I have to make many decisions and I havenât made any yet, what to do. It will depend on how I feel, on my personal plans, which I haveâ¦ because I want to finish my career at the highest level possible. We had the same discussion a year ago and Iâm still quite happy with that decision. Weâll see, now is the year that also leaves me a little more time to make the decision, I want it to be the right one.â âThe national team? Iâm thinking about it, there is a possibility, yes, but I donât know yetâ¦â He was also pressed on a potential retirement â he was open about the fact he was considering it last season, but after another stellar campaign where Kroos started the majority of matches, decided he should continue. âI always tell the truth, and that is that I donât know. Iâm thinking about what to do, but I havenât decided anything. Iâm glad that many people want me to play one more year, thatâs positive, more than the other way around (laughs). I havenât taken the decision.â âI will take it when I feel ready or I am clear about it, on the field it doesnât worry me one bitâ¦ It is an important decision but I am so happy with what I have achieved that I donât worry about it at all.â Madridistas will be hoping that he does indeed stick around for another year. While they have a stacked midfield in their squad, with plenty of options, nobody else gives them the control Kroos does. There is a strong case to be made that he is the best in La Liga at his position again this season, and they would no doubt feel his loss.","Madridistas will be hoping that he does indeed stick around for another year.

Phil Fodenâs stoppage-time goal gives them a two-goal cushion going into next monthâs second leg at the Etihad Stadium after Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva had found the net. But Pep Guardiola was left worried about the extent of a groin injury sustained by Jack Grealish â and saw Silva forced off after a nasty tackle on his ankle. City were left incensed by a Kevin Diks challenge that ripped Silvaâs socks and the Portuguese remonstrated with the fourth official as he was substituted. Grealish is a more pressing issue, however, and he is going for tests to ascertain the damage.  âItâs a pity, heâs gutted,â Guardiola said. âI didnât speak with the doctor but it looks muscular. The last few days his mood at training was much better. âHe played really good, he was helping us with the tempo. He wanted to continue but we didnât want to do even worse damage.â City were on the end of rough treatment all night and Guardiola added: âWe knew it beforehand. We talked about that. They are so aggressive. The referee made a good job. They gave to manage that. Hopefully Bernardo is not a big issue.â De Bruyne ended up with a goal and two assists as his form after hamstring surgery continues to sky rocket, a run that is coinciding with Fodenâs most consistent spell of his career. âIt's the longest run of games I think I've had in the team,â Foden said. âYou get a rhythm. I'm feeling good. You find your feet and you start getting connections with other players, I think that's what it's down to. âI just feel alive and that I'm always involved in the game. Me and Kevin have built that connection now so we know where we're running. He's such an important player for us.â Foden claimed that Cityâs players found communicating difficult in an electric atmosphere at Parken yet Guardiola believes his side quietened the hostile home crowd.   âThese type of games you expect the transitions where you suffer,â he said. âSlow it down in this incredible stadium with the crowd behind them. Make 1,000 passes, donât allow them to score a goal. Then the stadium goes down. âI saw the [Manchester] United games and how difficult it was for them. I knew it, the players knew it.â","âI saw the [Manchester] United games and how difficult it was for them. I knew it, the players knew it.â"

His reasoning for doing so stemmed from his love for Zinedine Zidane, who also wore the 5 for Los Blancos during his time in the Spanish capital.  Bellingham has since had an incredible start to life at Real Madrid, scoring 20 goals (and amassing eight assists) in just 29 appearances. Zidane has been following the English midfielderâs progress, and itâs safe to say that he has been very impressed, as he stated in an interview with Adidas (via MD). âHeâs an unbelievable player who does incredible things. You could have imagined what he was going to do, but heâs surpassed all the statistics with what heâs doing. âDonât forget that heâs only 20 years old. He arrived at Real Madrid with a lot of desire, a lot of goals and he is setting the bar very high. Heâs just showing everyone what he is and itâs great to see him like that. Iâm a big fan of his and now we want him to win trophies with Real Madrid. Itâs everything he wanted for himself.â Zidane also spoke on the continued speculation surrounding the future of Kylian Mbappe, who has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid. âThereâs a lot of talk about this, thereâs a lot of stories and rumours but the reality is that we still donât know whatâs going to happen. Weâll see what happens.â Should Mbappe indeed join Real Madrid in the summer, the prospect of him linking up with Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and co would be incredibly delightful for Real Madrid, and worrisome for everyone else in La Liga and across Europe.","Should Mbappe indeed join Real Madrid in the summer, the prospect of him linking up with Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and co would be incredibly delightful for Real Madrid, and worrisome for everyone else in La Liga and across Europe."

Steffani Jenz is married to husband Moritz Jenz, 24, who now plays in Germany for VfL Wolfsburg. The defender, who spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan at Celtic, was in action for his team's 1-0 defeat at Union Berlin in the Bundesliga when the shock incident occurred on Saturday.    Jenz had left the main bowl of the Stadion An der Alten Forsterei and headed to the ground's family section to feed their 11-month-old son. However, after finding a table and starting to feed, an irate Union Berlin supporter stormed over and began shouting at her while clutching a can of beer. The thug launched a volley of abuse and began pawing at baby Indiana Leonardo's toys as the shocked Steffani revealed how she âcouldn't sleep all nightâ afterwards due to the shock.  Posting on her Instagram account, the singer said: âYesterday I went to Berlin to watch my husband playing against Union. âDuring the first half I went inside to the family area, which was full of tables, almost all empty and I sat at one with my friend and started breastfeeding my 11-month-old son. âSuddenly a man over 70 approached me with a quite angry / disturbed face and started speaking in German and making a very rude sign that we have to leave. âHe is holding a beer and comes very close to me and put his scarf on top of our jackets.â  Steffani continued: âI have a small baby in my arms and this man looks very angry and gets too close to my baby, so I stand up and with my backpack in one arm I start to go to another table. âHe takes one toy of my son's and in a very rude way screams I have to take it.â She then told how the man began âsmacking his lips in a very vulgar wayâ before throwing the toy at her and the baby.  The furious Steffani says that she was ignored when reporting the abuse to catering workers before a security guard laughed at her when she complained to him. She said: âI explain the situation in detail and he doesn't really react to my words, like wondering what he should do about it?"" âI ask him to speak to this man. I see he goes towards him and after not even five seconds of conversation, they start to LAUGH together. âIn 2024, a woman still cannot feel safe to breastfeed in a 'familiar environment' like a stadium family area.â âNot one of the people I asked for help did anything or saved a kind word for me. âSadly we live in a society that not only doesn't condemn, but also protects these types of ignorant people.â She then addressed Union Berlin, who made history by appointing female coach Marie-Louise Eta as assistant manager in November, directly - which led to her receiving an official apology from the club. Steffani wrote: âYou are the first club with a female assistant coach and you call yourself a 'family club', but you should be careful who you hire and make sure to educate your staff about respect towards women and families. âI hope from the bottom of my heart that this doesn't happen anymore to any other woman cause it was utterly humiliating and distressing.â  Union Berlin responded to her on social media by writing: âDear Steffani, we are very sorry to hear about this matter and have forwarded your complaint to our head of security.  âWomen should be able to breastfeed their babies everywhere without harassment. Especially in a family area. We are trying to clear things up, thank you for sharing and speaking out!â That led to her replying with: âThank you so much for reaching out, I truly appreciate your concern and support.â","That led to her replying with: âThank you so much for reaching out, I truly appreciate your concern and support.â"

The Manchester United legend confirmed that KSI's promotion had been in touch over a possible fight. He claimed that 'a few' had been in touch to try and get him to swap the football pitch for the ring after his sacking by Birmingham City on January 2. Asked by Gary Neville on the Stick to Football podcast if he was going to fight, Rooney teased fans. 'Never know,' he said. 'They've been in touch and asked the question but I think at the minute, I want to focus on getting back into management, not boxing.  'They've been in touch to fight, yeah. There's been a few and obviously that Misfits have been in [touch] and that's been all over the news.' 'Not a great title, that, is it?' quipped Jamie Carragher. Rooney added: 'Listen, I want to focus on getting back into management. That's my focus. And I've seen all over the last couple of days all the headlines but my main focus is getting back in to football. Since its launch in 2022, Misfits has welcomed a smorgasbord of celebrities and would-be stars. Internet sensations such as KSI, Logan Paul, and Jay Swingler, music stars like Ashley and Myles from Rak-Su, and a host of other personalities have competed. Streamed on DAZN, it attracts millions of pay-per-view fans and has visited venues across England and the United States. Despite his disaster at Birmingham, where he replaced John Eustace and plummeted the side from sixth to 20th in the Championship, Rooney's managerial career has showed some semblance of promise. He won admirers for sticking out a difficult period at Derby County, where he was saddled with a 21-point deduction in 2021/22 and was relegated from the Championship.   He then went on to manage DC United in the MLS but only won 14 of his 53 games in charge. Rooney will be hoping to do better on his boxing debut than when was famously knocked out by then United team-mate Phil Bardsley. The two players were sparring in Rooney's kitchen and Bardsley caught the striker, knocking him to the floor. A video later appeared showing the knockdown and the story made national news. Rooney then performed an iconic celebration referencing the incident as he mimicked being knocked out when he scored against Tottenham at Old Trafford days later. Bardsley recalled the hilarious moment on the UTD Podcast in 2021. 'We were having a drink, having a laugh, playing guitar and the next minute these boxing gloves appear! I was thinking: 'what's going on here?' 'So my brother steps up, has a go with Wazza and obviously he loves his boxing, doesn't he? He loves scrapping. And then I'm like: 'give us them, I'll have a go'. 'He's throwing a few bombs and obviously he's a big lad, isn't he? Strong. We're exchanging blows â the Crocky [Croxteth] kid and the Salford kid, there's no holding back! 'He just walked into a jab. He was only out for a couple of seconds but we were all panicking â what's going on here?  'We didn't know what to do, panic stations and we had no phone signal. 'We were all thinking: ""if he doesn't open his eyes, we can't phone an ambulance, there's no signal."" So much panic! 'Anyway, he comes around, goes to the sink. I've got a big cut lip, blood everywhere and he's got some blood under his nose and we're just looking at each other and laughing.'","'Anyway, he comes around, goes to the sink.

The former Ajax captain is now unsettled in Munich and De Ligt is not 100% happy with his current role at Bayern, as reported by Sky Germany.

As for Arsenal, De Ligt has been discussed internally, but the Gunners have not initiated contact with either the player or Bayern Munich. Man Utd to sign Matthijs de Ligt? Man Utd are currently in pole position to sign De Ligt, who is likely to leave Bayern in the upcoming summer transfer window. Ten Hag worked with the Netherlands international during his time at Ajax and would like to bring him to Old Trafford this summer, with Man Utd desperate to sign a new centre-back in 2024. Lisandro Martinezâs recent injury has highlighted the need for another acquisition in that position, while Evertonâs Jarrad Branthwaite and OGC Niceâs Jean-Clair Todibo have both been linked as De Ligt alternatives. Man Utd attempted to sign De Ligt in 2019, but he opted to join Juventus for â¬85.5 million instead. The Red Devils have been monitoring the Bayern star ever since and are now ready to sign him this summer.","Man Utd attempted to sign De Ligt in 2019, but he opted to join Juventus for â¬85.5 million instead.

297,Mainoo considering international options despite growing interest from Southgate,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mainoo-considering-international-options-despite-growing-interest-from-Southgate/3300911,13 Feb,"Manchester United midfield player Kobbie Mainoo is planning to keep his international options open until later this year despite growing interest from Gareth Southgate.  The England manager watched Mainooâs 10th successive Premier League start for United in their 2-1 win at Aston Villa yesterday, but the 18-year-old is also eligible for Ghana and in no rush to make a decision. Mainoo will accept any call-up he is offered by England having already represented them at under 16, under 18 and under 19 level, but has no immediate plans to make a definitive decision on his international career. The Stockport-born midfield player qualifies for Ghana through his parents, with Ghana FA Board member Randy Abbey telling The Times last week that they are hopeful of persuading Mainoo to switch his allegiance to the Black Stars. Mainoo is expected to defer his decision until he is confident of breaking into the senior England squad on a regular basis, which despite his impressive performances for United is not likely to be until the autumn at the earliest.  Southgate has previously shown a willingness to fast-track talented young players with dual nationality into his senior squad, with Mason Greenwood given his first cap at the age of 18 for example, but this approach is not practical with Mainoo in the short term as England do not have any competitive matches other than the European Championship until September. As previously reported by Mail Sport the FA are confident of retaining Mainooâs services, but have not been given any guarantees. Under FIFA eligibility rules a player can change their nationality at any time if they have only played in friendlies, while those aged under 21 can also switch after three years if they have played fewer than three competitive matches. Mainoo will not make a formal decision until he is in contention for competitive senior caps, which given the proximity of the European Championship is not expected to be until the autumn at the earliest.   England have friendlies against Brazil and Belgium next month, and warm-up games against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland in June, before beginning their next UEFA Nations League campaign with matches against Republic of Ireland and Finland in September. While Mainoo has impressed in a defensive midfield role for United Southgate is convinced he will develop into a box-to-box attacking player, putting him in the same bracket as Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden rather than Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips. Given his impressive performances in recent months however, a first call-up for Lee Carsleyâs under 21 squad next month for their European Championship qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Luxembourg is a distinct possibility.","Given his impressive performances in recent months however, a first call-up for Lee Carsleyâs under 21 squad next month for their European Championship qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Luxembourg is a distinct possibility."

However, the scoreline only tells half of the story, in what was a largely disappointing match for Los Blancos.  The hosts had several big chances to score, but Andriy Lunin stood tall to stop everything that came at him. The Ukrainian goalkeeper made nine saves, earning rave reviews in the process. The latest came from his head coach Carlo Ancelotti, who spoke on the 25-year-old after the full time whistle in Leipzig, as per Diario AS. âHeâs a goalkeeper who hasnât had any minutes and heâs progressing. The fact that heâs playing is giving him confidence. I think itâs the best heâs played.â Lunin was unable to stop Benjamin Sesko from scoring inside the opening minutes, although it was ruled out, somewhat controversial. Ancelotti addressed the matter. âIâve seen him offside. He was behind Lunin.â Real Madrid will now look to finish the tie off in three weeksâ time, although there is plenty of La Liga action to be played before then, starting with the trip to managerless Rayo Vallecano this weekend.","Real Madrid will now look to finish the tie off in three weeksâ time, although there is plenty of La Liga action to be played before then, starting with the trip to managerless Rayo Vallecano this weekend."

300,Gallagher's girlfriend dances in Chelsea away end as fans chant the star's name,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Gallaghers-girlfriend-dances-in-Chelsea-away-end-as-fans-chant-the-stars-name/3301352,14 Feb,"Chelsea star Conor Gallagher's girlfriend Aine Kennedy danced in the stands as supporter's chanted the midfielder's name following his match winning display against Crystal Palace on Monday night.  Gallagher took a starring role against Crystal Palace, with the one-time Eagles loanee scoring twice at Selhurst Park. The 24-year-old's second goal in stoppage time gave the Blues a 2-1 lead, with Enzo Fernandez adding a third in the closing seconds. Kennedy, 26, shared Instagram stories from the Chelsea away end during the 3-1 victory to show her support for Gallagher. The Irish model and professional dancer shared a post of the Blues celebrations after Enzo Fernandez's clinching goal with the caption 'Our boys'.   Kennedy was also captured by Djina Petrovic, the wife of goalkeeper Djordje, dancing as Chelsea supporters sang Gallagher's name after his second goal. She reshared the clip adding the caption 'Just so happy, you are fabulous.â Kennedy and Petrovic, a former Miss Serbia, posted clips at full-time of the Chelsea players applauding the away support following the victory. Gallagher had earned the acclaim of the Cheslea support after the academy product's match winning performance. The England international had brought the Blues level in the second half, cancelling out Jefferson Lerma's stunning opener for the hosts. Gallagher put the Blues ahead in the 91st minute, calmly slotting beyond Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson. His strike prompted jubilant scenes in the away end, with celebrations between players and supporters causing an advertising board in front of the away fans to give way. Axel Disasi was spotted launching himself backwards on top of several fans that had encroached to join their team, as the defender attempted to crowd surf.    Gallagher's two goals meant the midfielder has three in two games for the club, after previously enduring a 34-game goal drought. Enzo Fernandez sealed the victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time, with the result easing pressure on manager Mauricio Pochettino as Chelsea climbed back into the top half. Pochettino had hailed Gallagher as 'priceless' post-match. 'He's a player with great commitment with the team,' Pochettino said. 'Always trying to compensate every situation in an offensive and defensive situation and that is priceless to have a player like him. 'I'm so happy for him and I'm so happy for the team because it's a victory we needed, the three points to confirm the reaction after Wolverhampton. 'It was a very good game against Aston Villa and it was a great opportunity.'",'It was a very good game against Aston Villa and it was a great opportunity.'
301,Atletico Madrid given boost as Barcelona set to drop out of race for 24-year-old free agent,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Atletico-Madrid-given-boost-as-Barcelona-set-to-drop-out-of-race-for-24-year-old-free-agent/3302279,1 day ago,"Barcelona are making decisions on who to go for in the upcoming transfer window, both on the pitch and on the bench, and it appears that one of those calls will benefit Atletico Madrid and Villarreal. Despite reports that one of Barcelonaâs three targets this summer will be a left-back, along with a left-winger and midfielder, Marca say that they will not sign a left-sided defender.  That is because Barcelona will try to save money on a back-up for Alejandro Balde. While the Blaugrana will reportedly consider offers for Balde, unless they do sell him, they will be concerned merely with replacing veteran Marcos Alonso as an alternative to Balde, who is out of contract this summer. Earmarked for that role is Alex Valle, a La Masia product who is on loan at Levante currently. Bojan Krkic has been keeping an eye on Valle all season has clearly seen enough to be convinced that Valle can make the jump. He has started 21 games for Levante in Segunda, and has been decent if unspectacular thus far. It does mean that Sergi Cardona, who is out of contract with Las Palmas at the end of the season, and was reportedly being watched by the Blaugrana, has one less suitor, provided the reports are credible. Atletico Madrid and Villarreal have also been closely linked with Cardona, who has informed Las Palmas that he will not be extending his deal beyond the summer.","It does mean that Sergi Cardona, who is out of contract with Las Palmas at the end of the season, and was reportedly being watched by the Blaugrana, has one less suitor, provided the reports are credible.

302,Leeds Patrick Bamford appears to score with his elbow & uses it for celebration,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Leeds-Patrick-Bamford-appears-to-score-with-his-elbow--uses-it-for-celebration/3299294,11 Feb,"Patrick Bamford scored in controversial fashion during Leeds' win over Rotherham, leaving the visiting boss fuming at a 'blatant handball' missed by officials.  Bamford found the back of the net inside the opening 10 minutes of Leeds' 3-0 victory on Saturday, before Crysencio Summerville scored a brace later in the game. However, there was much debate around Bamford's strike after he appeared to use his elbow to help guide the ball into the Rotherham net. In the 10th minute of the game, full-back Junior Firpo whipped in a cross that Bamford helped direct into the net. However, replays that later appeared on X, formerly known as Twitter, appeared to show the striker sticking out his elbow to push the ball in the goal.  Bamford, however, made sure there was no confusion as to what had happened as he wheeled away and used his elbow in celebration. The forward jumped in the air to rejoice at his goal, sticking his elbow out in a similar fashion to moments before, as he did so. Leeds' official account on X, formerly known as Twitter, appeared to make light of the situation as they posted the goal with the caption: 'They all count!'. However, Rotherham boss Leam Richardson was left fuming with the incident and insisted that officials missed a 'clear' handball. He said: 'It's a blatant handball. It's a tough place to come to anyway and if you get decisions like that going against you then you're up against it. 'It should have been an easy decision for the referee to disallow it. 'I thought we started the match terrifically well. We took the game to them. But then a big decision went against us and it was an uphill challenge from there. 'Patrick's [Bamford] admitted after the event that the ball has hit his arm. You expect those decisions to go with you when it's as clear as that.'   Back in October, Bamford was labelled a 'diving cheat' by a commentator, after he appeared to dive in Leeds' clash with QPR in an incident that saw keeper Asmir Begovic sent off for the visitors. In the game, Bamford broke free and ran at Begovic, only for the Bosnian to lunge into a tackle and get himself sent off - but despite the striker dramatically hitting the deck, there was no contact. As such, QPR commentators were incensed at the England striker's actions and wasted no time in making their real feelings known, shouting: 'There's no touch he's a diving cheat!' Seconds later as Bamford stood over the ball to take the free-kick in the 93rd minute which he had seemingly bought, the commentators continued their barrage: 'Bamford the cheat will take the free-kick, left-footed from outside the box'.","Seconds later as Bamford stood over the ball to take the free-kick in the 93rd minute which he had seemingly bought, the commentators continued their barrage: 'Bamford the cheat will take the free-kick, left-footed from outside the box'."

Stranraer clash against Clyde on Saturday afternoon was expected to be a fiery clash, with both teams situated towards the bottom of the Scottish League Two. The hosts won the clash 2-0 - thanks to goals from Kyle Fleming and Finn Ecrepont - however scenes turned ugly after the final whistle after fan trouble. According to The Sun, flares and pyrotechnics were thrown onto the pitch as a brawl been supporters began to break out. It's alleged that the violent scenes ensued after the final whistle, when several local fans reportedly attacked away supporters with golf clubs. Police were forced to intervene and later confirmed that two individuals had been arrested following the incident. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: 'Around 5pm on Saturday, 10 February 2024, police received a report of a disturbance in the London Road area of Stranraer. 'Two men aged 48 and 23 were arrested and charged in connection with the incident. 'A report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.' The Sun further claim that police officers in possession of tasers were in attendance at the match, however no taser discharges were made. Police Scotland also released a statement over the use of pyrotechnics at the match, which read: 'Officers are carrying out enquiries in relation to a report of pyrotechnics being used at the conclusion of a football match at Stair Park, Stranraer. 'Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 2456 of Saturday, 10 February, 2024.'  Flyde secured victory on the day after Ecrepont scored 'one of the best goals Stair Park has ever seen', according to the club's social media. The full-back spotted the goalkeeper off his line and, from his own half, lifted the ball over him and into the back of the net in spectacular fashion. The three points see Stranraer sit eighth in the table, as they put an end to their three game winless streak. Meanwhile, Clyde sit 10th - which is bottom - of the Scottish League Two and are currently 10 points from safety.","Meanwhile, Clyde sit 10th - which is bottom - of the Scottish League Two and are currently 10 points from safety."

The 20-year-old was in considerable pain upon the incident occurring, but carried on to score Real Madridâs third of the evening immediately after. However, only a minute or so later, he asked to be substituted, which was a big worry, especially with the Champions League last 16 clash with RB Leipzig on the horizon. Real Madrid have confirmed that Bellingham suffered an ankle injury against Girona, and it has been reported by Jose Luis Sanchez that the English midfielder will be out of action for 2-3 weeks. It means that Bellingham will miss Tuesdayâs first leg against Leipzig, as well as La Liga matches against Rayo Vallecano and Sevilla at the very least. He could also miss the trip to Valencia, although he should be back in time to face Leipzig at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real Madrid have announced that midfielder Jude Bellingham sustained a sprained ankle during Saturdayâs 4-0 win against Girona. Bellingham will be out around three weeks with this injury. Following tests carried out today on Jude Bellingham by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a sprain in his left ankle. His recovery will be monitored. While both Carlo Ancelotti and team doctors were somewhat hopeful that Bellingham could feature in Tuesdayâs match against Red Bull Leipzig in the Champions Leagueâs Round of 16, the star midfielder will have to miss that game and also a few more. Bellingham will be expected to make his return when Real Madrid host Leipzig in the return leg, which will be played on March 6th. Los Blancos will not rush him back and while he could rejoined the squad in two or three weeks, Ancelotti will likely take a cautious approach with his star player.","Bellingham will be expected to make his return when Real Madrid host Leipzig in the return leg, which will be played on March 6th.

A hamstring problem has kept him out of tonightâs squad but he will soon return to the team who had the best defensive record in the group stage. Tierney moved to Real Sociedad last summer. He was convinced the team was right and Arsenal team-mate Martin Odegaard, who played on loan there while a Real Madrid player, allayed any fears about settling in. âI did speak to him a lot and he was helpful,â says Tierney. âThey love him here. They would want him back any time.â  Odegaardâs San Sebastian recommendations were mainly food-based and itâs one of the pluses of playing for the club that Spanish cuisine doesnât get much better than in the Basque Country. âThe chuleton, yeah!â says Tierney of the local steak. âIt is the best I have had in my life. Iâm not big on taking pictures of food but I make an exception when I order that. And thereâs a dish thatâs rice and clams. âSee, just me saying this, I can see my mates saying, âYouâve changed man! When would you ever eat rice with clams? You never got that growing upâ.â Tierney might still be at Arsenal this season if not for injuries and for Mikel Artetaâs preference for inverted full backs. âAt Arsenal the left back can be one of the most central players in the team,â he says. âIf itâs Oleksandr Zinchenko then he is one of the biggest creators from a central position. âWhen that got introduced it was alien to me. I had never played centre midfield, I started as a winger. I was trying to learn that when I was at Arsenal. âWhen you see how well it works it is hard to question it. My choice was to just get on with it and learn and I got to practise it with one of the best. Itâs so natural to Zinchenko, he makes it look so easy.â Tierney has a lot of affection for Arsenal, who gave him his first move away from home when he left Celtic in 2019.   âComing here was easier than going to London, and thatâs not having a dig at Arsenal because they helped me massively. Without the people at the club it would have been 10 times harder to adapt, but I was four years younger and moving from Scotland, it didnât matter where I went, that was going to be the hardest part.  âItâs an amazing thing to go to play for Arsenal but you still have your hurdles to overcome. Then a couple of months later Covid hits and you donât get to see anyone for months. The people at Arsenal were all amazing.â At Real Sociedad the demands are similar to at Celtic, with coach Imanol Alguacil preferring his full backs to stay wide. Itâs not the only thing that reminds Tierney of playing in Glasgow. âThese boys here are like me playing for Celtic,â he says of his team-mates. âGrowing up, the club is all you know and all you want. When I was there in the first team there were maybe four or five from the academy but here itâs more like 13 â itâs on the next level. You can tell they have been playing with each other for years. Itâs second nature â they donât need to think about what decision they take. âI am still learning every single day but I think I am adapting to how they want to play and itâs more natural to me now.â Will his future lead back to Arsenal? âItâs hard to say,â he says. âI loved my time there and I still have two years on the contract.  âI am very grateful to Arsenal. I donât know whatâs going to happen but I am absolutely loving it here. I feel I have adapted quite well and I hope I can return the faith the club have shown. âThis is a very, very talented squad with world-class players and so many have come from the academy.

Meanwhile Paris Saint-Germain will be hoping Luis Enrique is the one that can turn their fortunes around in Europe, but face a tricky Real Sociedad in his first knockout tie. Hereâs how we think the first legs will play out.  Feargal Brennan:Â  Real Madrid look ready to partially switch tracks in the run in after opening up a five point La Liga title lead. Whilst Carlo Ancelotti wonât admit it, he knows he can split resources, and keep extra freshness for Europe. No Jude Bellingham is an issue, but RB Leipzig donât seem to have the engine room to capitalise, and their form has dipped. Lois Openda will be one to watch for against a patched up Los Blancos defence. But, Ancelotti will be confident of bringing a first leg lead back to Madrid. Score Prediction: RB Leipzig 0-2 Real Madrid John Menzies:Â Real Madrid will fancy their chances of a 15th European Cup/Champions League, and they will certainly be one of the favourites. Jude Bellingham will be a big miss for Carlo Ancelotti, but they have more than enough firepower to break down the Bundesliga sideâs underperforming defence. Score Prediction: RB Leipzig 1-3 Real Madrid Ruairidh Barlow:Â Real Madrid will of course be on a high after their Girona clash, but itâs also true that they were superlative in that match â expecting them to hit that level again three days later is a lot. They play a Leipzig side that traditionally given them problems in the past, but their lack of solidity at the back will be exploited. The lack of Jude Bellingham robs Los Blancos of some of their goal threat though, and so it will still be in play come the second leg. Score Prediction: RB Leipzig 1-2 Real Madrid For more on team news ahead of the match, click here. FB: Real Sociedad are more than capable of continuing Paris Saint-Germainâs Champions League woes, although their inability to score goals of late could cost them, especially with the French champions having Kylian Mbappe back from injury. Imanol Alguacil will hope to keep it tight in Paris ahead of the return leg at the Reale Arena. Score Prediction: PSG 1-0 Real Sociedad JM: PSG are waltzing to a Ligue 1 title defence but their Champions League question marks remain. After scraping through the group stages they meet a well coached La Real missing some key players. If Mikel Oyarzabal misses out, Imanol Alguacil will tweak his team, but a return leg in San Sebatian could see a shock. Score Prediction: PSG 1-1 Real Sociedad RB:Â Valentineâs day in the city of love for Real Sociedad, but the Txuri-Urdin might be reminded of the painful side of romance against PSG. If this match had occurred in November, La Real would stand a chance of taking a win, but Luis Enrique has had an extra few months to the tinker and adjust his PSG, while Imanol Alguacil is furiously trying to work their way out of their usual new year dip.

308,PSG fans hold up banners demanding the mayor of Paris 'resigns',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/PSG-fans-hold-up-banners-demanding-the-mayor-of-Paris-resigns/3299402,11 Feb,"PSG supporters group, Collectif Ultras Paris, have called for the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to resign after 'killing' the 'magic' in the city.  The supporters group held up a banner during Les Parisiens' Ligue 1 match against Lille on Saturday evening with a message directed at the mayor. The banner being held up in the Auteuil stand at the Parc des Princes read, 'Hidalgo kills Paris and it's magic'. While fans chanted 'Hidalgo Resign'. The banner was unveiled shortly after it was confirmed that PSG would be leaving the Parc des Princes - which has been their home since 1974. Les Parisiens revealed they would be leaving the iconic venue earlier in the week, stating City had decided the stadium was not for sale.   The club owned by cash-rich Qatari backer QSI wanted to stay and own the stadium but, following eight years of discussions, they will have to look elsewhere. PSG said last year that they would explore alternatives after Paris mayor Hidalgo said the stadium was not for sale - a position that City Hall confirmed on Tuesday. Paris deputy mayor for sports Pierre Rabadan said: 'A sale is not desirable, because that would be a decision with no turning back. Rabadan added: 'That's why we have to rule out the sale of the Parc de Princes today. We don't want to sell off Paris' legacy.' The Parc des Princes has been home to Paris Saint-Germain since 1974, four years after the club was founded. In January, PSG said it had invested more than 85 million euros ($92 million) in stadium maintenance costs. At the time, PSG said it was committed to investing a further 500 million euros in renovations in order to compete with other clubs at the highest level in Europe. The club will instead focus on finding a new home. The club did not give a deadline for its departure - according to 90min.com. The first option is the 20,000-capacity Stade Jean-Bouin, also owned by the City of Paris, located near the Parc des Princes.   It currently holds PSGâs womenâs team while playing host to rugby and American football matches too. A second option could be the government-owned 20,000 seater Stade Sebastien Charlety. It is currently the home of minnows Paris FC, but PSG would knock it down before building a new venue holding up to 75,000 fans. The third site is the 30,000-seater Paris La Defense Arena, home of rugby side Racing 92. They are set to return to their renovated Yves-Du-Manoir stadium after the Olympic Games. PSG could also consider building a brand new stadium by their training camp in Poissy.

Lazio won the first-leg of their round 16 tie 1-0 thanks to Ciro Immobile's successful penalty. Sarri later said: âIt was a victory earned with application, effort and suffering. âThere is great satisfaction at beating one of the best teams in Europe, but also regrets that we wasted opportunities late on. âWe moved throughout the game like an entity with one mind. It was normal to have moments of suffering within it, but we also had lots of scoring opportunities. Fortunately, we converted one of them."" However, Sarri added: âIn the final 15 minutes, we seemed more worried about bringing home the victory than making it an even wider advantage."" On the return-leg, Sarri warned: âTuchel has won far more than me, so he will know what to do.

310,Virgil van Dijk urges Liverpool teammate Harvey Elliot to not be 'frustrated',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Virgil-van-Dijk-urges-Liverpool-teammate-Harvey-Elliot-to-not-be-frustrated/3300691,12 Feb,"For all the talk about Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland making Manchester City impregnable, Liverpool are feeling bullish about the strength of their own squad.  Missing key players including Mohamed Salah and Alisson, Jurgen Kloppâs side got the job done in front of Anfieldâs record league crowd, even when Trent Alexander-Arnoldâs injury left them without a recognised right back for the second half. Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo have all scored critical goals from the bench this season and on Saturday it was another substitute, Harvey Elliott, who made the difference with two match-winning assists after his half-time introduction. Elliott has started 25 Premier League games for Liverpool and been a replacement in 35. Itâs not the ratio an ambitious 20-year-old would want but skipper Virgil van Dijk stressed the need for the whole squad to contribute if Liverpool are to give Klopp a farewell Premier League title. âIâm sure Harvey would love to be playing every week but at the highest level you have to be patient and grab your moments when you get them,â said Van Dijk.   âHe has to keep going. Donât be frustrated that you donât start sometimes, it is part of the business. When you get your opportunities, you have to perform and thatâs what Harvey has done in this case. âSubs have made a big impact for us in games this season and this was another clear example. That definitely needs to be the case going forward as well.â Although Burnley looked an easy enough fixture on paper, Klopp knew the potential pitfalls and was even more animated than usual along the touchline. The late withdrawals of Alisson and Joe Gomez with flu added to the patched-up feel of Liverpoolâs line-up with Salah, Joel Matip and Dominik Szoboszlai injured, Ibrahima Konate suspended and Conor Bradley unavailable following the death of his father. Nerves jangled when a header from Dara OâShea cancelled out Diogo Jotaâs opener and Alexander-Arnold didnât reappear after the interval because of discomfort in his knee, forcing Klopp to send on Elliott (right) and switch Curtis Jones to right back for the first time in his career. Elliott did enough in 45 minutes to be the man of the match. He brought energy to the right flank and delivered crosses for Diaz and Nunez to score and maintain Liverpoolâs two-point advantage at the top. It was great theatre in front of 59,896, eclipsing the previous highest attendance dating back to 1949, as the upper tier of the Anfield Road Stand opened. âOutrageously wonderful,â is how Klopp described it. âIt was really loud in the right moments.â  With City yet to travel to Anfield this season, that atmosphere could be a 12th man. Burnley boss Vincent Kompany acknowledged: âItâs a crowd with a lot of history and passion for the team. Thatâs always tough.â Emotions ran high with both managers booked for protesting â Klopp when Jota didnât get a penalty, Kompany for claiming a foul on Aaron Ramsey in the build-up to Liverpoolâs second goal. With Andy Robertson starting his first game since October, Kostas Tsimikas also back off the bench and Salah and Bradley due to return to training next week, Liverpool are set to get stronger, particularly if Alexander-Arnoldâs issue is as minor as hoped. City get kudos for the strength of their bench, with De Bruyne and Jack Grealish coming on at the weekend, but there is no inferiority complex at Anfield. âIâve been very impressed by our players who have come in,â added Van Dijk. âItâs important for guys to grab their moments and they are doing it.â For joint-bottom Burnley, things donât get any easier despite their enterprise. Next up for them are Arsenal. .",.
311,Hargreaves heaps praise on Loftus-Cheek after fomer Blues midfielder nets twice,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hargreaves-heaps-praise-on-Loftus-Cheek-after-fomer-Blues-midfielder-nets-twice/3302595,18 hours ago,"Owen Hargreaves lauded Ruben Loftus-Cheek's decision to move away from Chelsea after the midfielder struck twice in AC Milan's Europa League play-off tie against Rennes on Thursday evening.  The 28-year-old Blues academy graduate left his boyhood club after 19 years as part of the summer exodus from Stamford Bridge which saw a number of former first-team starters sold to offset the club's mammoth transfer window spending. Loftus-Cheek has settled quickly in Milan and become a regular fixture under Stefano Pioli alongside fellow ex-Chelsea stars Olivier Giroud, Christian Pulisic, and Fikayo Tomori. The midfielder has netted seven times across all competitions, registering an additional two assists in Serie A, and Thursday night's brace saw him become the first Rossoneri to score twice in a European knockout game since Kaka in 2007. After the final whistle, Hargreaves not only described Loftus-Cheek as a 'good fit' at the San Siro, but wondered whether the player might even wish he had moved abroad sooner.   'Just looking at it, I can't believe Ruben Loftus-Cheek is 28 already,' Hargreaves said on duty for TNT Sports. 'I know he's always been a star as a young man but he probably should have made this move (abroad) a little bit sooner. 'He's such a talented guy. Probably played a little bit deeper at times. This is where he's at his absolute best, arriving in the box with his size. He's a good header of the ball. He's got goals in him. 'It shows he's in a really good place, in a team that plays to his strengths. And he's scoring goals. That one (the second goal), he's a little bit fortunate, it arrives to him. 'I think the confidence has grown. We've always known that he's such a talented player, he's obviously not a boy anymore, 28, he should be at his absolute best.' Like his former Chelsea team-mate Tomori - and a number of young talents including Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and Real Madrid superstar Jude Bellingham - Hargreaves believes that Loftus-Cheek is feeling the benefits of playing away from the scrutiny of his boyhood club. 'I just think there's less noise around you (abroad),' Hargreaves added. 'You know when you've got your friends and family around you, everyone is on you. Sometimes you just want to focus on the football, but you can't if you're in your home town. 'There he'll probably be able to focus on his craft, learn a new language, learn a new culture. 'I would advise it to every player - leave your comfort zone and go play somewhere else, just even for a few years. I just think you learn so much.'  The former Manchester United midfielder can attest to the importance of a player spending a portion of their career away from the Premier League, having started as a youth player at Bayern Munich. The 41-year-old spent the first six years of his senior career in Bavaria before booking his move to Manchester in 2007. The 3-0 victory on home turf sets Milan up well ahead of the second-leg of their play-off tie after the side dropped down from the Champions League after finishing behind Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain in the group stages. Milan will face Atalanta next weekend before they travel to France, and will hope to leapfrog Juventus to sit second in the table with a win against the fourth-placed side.","Milan will face Atalanta next weekend before they travel to France, and will hope to leapfrog Juventus to sit second in the table with a win against the fourth-placed side."

The Canadian defender is one of their top targets, but the current occupier of the left-back slot might not be making way for him.  Last summer it seemed certain that Ferland Mendy would be departing Real Madrid, as Saudi Arabia sounded him out for an offer, and the Frenchman battled relentless injuries. This year he has managed to remain fit, and as a result has rediscovered his form. Earlier in the season Ancelotti called him the best defensive left-back in the world, and despite the fact they may be about to recruit arguably the best offensive left-back in the game, Ancelotti has told Los Blancos he would renew Mendyâs contract. The 28-year-old is out of contract in 2025, meaning it would make sense for Real Madrid to offer him a new deal or sell him. Relevo say that it is not ruled out that Mendy is offered a new deal, as Los Blancos wait to see how the Davies situation will play out â even if it is merely to sell him down the line. The very fact that they are asking Ancelottiâs opinion suggests that Real Madrid are at least open to the idea of keeping him. His injury history and age would suggest that it is a good time to move Mendy on, but there is no doubt that his return to form has seen their defence improve dramatically this season.","The very fact that they are asking Ancelottiâs opinion suggests that Real Madrid are at least open to the idea of keeping him.

Cue, soap opera #2, where will he end up?  One of the biggest stories of the last five years, which has generated thousands of column inches and countless speculation and intrigue finally seems to be coming to an end as Kylian MbappÃ© is set to leave PSG. The news, broken originally by The Athletic and verified by AS on Thursday evening, has led to dismay in the world of French football as Ligue 1 is set to lose its greatest asset with the PSG striker set to embark on a new chapter in his career. MbappÃ© informed PSG director Al KhelaÃ¯fi of his intentions on Tuesday, before PSGâs training session ahead of the Champions League Round of 16 clash against Real Sociedad. The strikerâs objective was to free himself from issues concerning his future and the striker remained true to his word in initially informing the Qatari executive of his decision not to remain in Paris. The PSG president then told Luis Enrique the news but seemed to have little impact on the playerâs performance against Real Sociedad with the striker bagging the first goal as part of a 2-0 win. Both the club and player will stage a press conference together in the forthcoming months to officially announce the decision and despite all signs indicating that the forward will sport the famous white Real Madrid jersey next season, Arsenal and Liverpool have been cited as alternative destinations. His departure from Parc des Princes also heralds the end of the PSG âgalacticoâ project with Neymar and Messi having departed the Parisian side for new adventures in Saudi Arabia and the US respectively. PSG, however, have long suspected that MbappÃ©'s time in Paris was set to come to an end. In France, pessimism had been creeping in for weeks, despite Al KhelaÃ¯fiâs attempts to remain calm in front of the media. The club have in parallel being working on life without MbappÃ© next season and according to early speculation Victor Osimhen (Napoli) and Rafael Leao (Milan) are two of the strikers the club are looking at as potential strikers to lead the PSG attack for the 2024-25 campaign.","PSG, however, have long suspected that MbappÃ©'s time in Paris was set to come to an end.

At the end of January, Martial was ruled out for 10 weeks following groin surgery as his career at Old Trafford continues to fizzle out. It also places a question mark over whether Martial, 28, will play for the club again as he prepares to depart Old Trafford in the summer. United are not extending his Â£250,000-a-week contract, meaning the Frenchman can leave as a free agent nine years after signing from Monaco in a transfer that made him the most expensive teenager in world football. Now, it seems as though the 28-year-old could make a stunning return to French football in summer, with a number of Ligue 1 teams taking interest in the soon-to-be free agent.  According to The Sun, former club Monaco and Marseille are keeping tabs on the United forward ahead of contract expiring in summer. Martial spent three seasons at Monaco, before making the move to Old Trafford, when he scored 15 goals and picked up eight assists from 70 appearances. Monaco have finished third in two of the last three seasons and currently sit in the same position in the Ligue 1 table - only trailing to PSG and Nice. Marseille, meanwhile, had a slow start to the season but, after recovering their form, currently sit eighth in the French top-flight standings. Back in 2015, Martial cost United Â£36million but the deal was worth up to Â£58m including add-ons. The erratic forward, who had a spell on loan at Sevilla two years ago, has scored 90 goals in 317 games in a United career disrupted by injury.   Mail Sport revealed last month that Martial was training on his own to regain fitness after being absent since early-December through illness, and his agent Philippe Lamboley confirmed he had a groin problem that would require an operation. A United statement said: âAnthony Martial has completed successful surgery to address a groin complaint and will be out of action for about 10 weeks as he rehabilitates.â The forward has made just 13 Premier League appearances for the Red Devils this season after dealing with a number of injuries. During that time, the Frenchman has scored just one goal which came during their 3-0 win over Everton back in November.","During that time, the Frenchman has scored just one goal which came during their 3-0 win over Everton back in November."

The Tunisian moved from Old Trafford to Spain in the January transfer window on a temporary deal for the remainder of the season, with an option to make the deal permanent for around Â£15m. Mejbri made his long-awaited break into United's first-team during the first half of the season and was relied upon by Erik ten Hag at a time when the club were facing a midfield injury crisis. The 21-year-old moved to Seville boasting a reputation as one of Man United's most exciting academy prospects, but quickly fell out of favour with manager Quique Sanchez Flores. He has so far played just 36 minutes in all competitions for the former Europa League winners and hasn't made an appearance since coming off the bench for eight minutes against Rayo Vallecano at the start of February.  Mejbri was tipped by Sevilla recruitment experts to be the January signing that would give them the biggest boost, but the club don't want to extend his stay past the end of the season, as reported by Estadio Deportivo. The talented youngster prefers to be deployed as an attacking midfielder but can play across all midfield positions and in the frontline if required. Complaints of problems with Mejbri's attitude and commitment were first raised by Sevilla shortly after he arrived at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan stadium. Flores called him out following his debut against LaLiga title chasers Girona, fuming:  'After being with him, talking to him and having seen his first minutes in Girona, we are going to give him the necessary space to understand where he is, that he is at Sevilla and what it means. 'He has to know where he is and we want to see him. We have spoken with him and we believe that he has to have some time to learn, we wanted to give him space, time for him to see things from the outside and then he will return to the squad.   'In the end they are kids who have come and suddenly land in a huge club like Sevilla in circumstances of maximum demand. 'And they need a bit of location. And that location may be seen better from the outside than from the inside. You should take a step to understand what we want. 'Let's see if the boy applies himself and I think that in the end he will understand perfectly what we want.'

The German giants were beaten 1-0 at Lazio in the Champions League last-16 first-leg on Wednesday night - with defender Dayot Upamecano suspended for the return leg after being shown a straight red card in the second half. That result came four days after they were soundly outplayed at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga in a 3-0 loss - a result that sees them five points behind their rivals in the German top-flight. Serial winners Bayern - who embarrassingly lost to third-division outfit Saarbrucken in the German Cup - now face the unfamiliar feeling of ending a season trophyless. And reflecting on a nightmare few days, Kane is adamant they can turn around their fortunes.   'Really tough week. In the first half, we started well and had clear chances, one for myself. In these games, they're big moments,' the striker reflected to TNT Sports post-match after defeat at Lazio. 'The second half was disappointing. We came out with less energy and less confidence. We got punished. Once you go down to 10 men it's always difficult. 'We have to find it among ourselves. We're still in the race for the Bundesliga and still in this tie. We have to keep fighting. 'We're in a difficult spell. We have to fight. We have to turn it around. We have big games and big things to fight for. We're not out of it, we will never give up. We just need to turn it around. One game or spark can turn it around.'  Bayern will look to put their Bundesliga title charge back on track on Sunday afternoon when they visit Bochum. After the trip to west Germany, Bayern face Leipzig (February 24) and Freiburg (March 1) before entertaining Lazio in the return leg of the European encounter.","After the trip to west Germany, Bayern face Leipzig (February 24) and Freiburg (March 1) before entertaining Lazio in the return leg of the European encounter."

The Portuguese was manager at Old Trafford between 2016 and 2018 but was unable to take them back to Premier League glory. Mourinho won the EFL Cup and the UEFA Europa League in his first season at United before leading them to a second-place Premier League finish in 2017-18. But his tenure quickly unravelled during his third season with poor results and a fall-out with several prominent players - including Â£89m Paul Pogba - led to his sacking on December 18. Speaking to former United defender Rio Ferdinand, Mourinho said his efforts to 'clean the house' at United fell short.   'Do you buy new furniture units before cleaning the house? I was more about cleaning the house than buying new furniture [signings],' Mourinho, global ambassador for Football.com, said. 'We didn't clean it the way we wanted. I wanted to clean from the second season and we couldn't for different reasons. 'I cannot say that I was asking for A, B, C or D in the third season because that was not right. I just knew clearly by the third season what I didn't want there. 'In terms of the individuals, in terms of the profiles, I knew clearly what I didn't want, but it didn't happen.

Veteran defender Paulista completed a January transfer move from Valencia to cover a squad spot in Diego Simeoneâs plans. Simeone handed the Brazilian a club debut in last weekendâs 1-0 La Liga defeat at Sevilla but he looks set to miss the upcoming home tie against Las Palmas.  As per reports from Marca, Paulista has not trained fully this week, due to an abdominal injury suffered at Sevilla. He could be rested against Las Palmas to give the 33-year-old centre back a chance of facing Inter Milan on February 20. Simeone will make a late call on whether to include him in the travelling squad for their Champions League last 16 first leg at the San Siro with his current status at 50/50.

Ratcliffe's INEOS group completed a deal for 25 per cent of the club in December, with the British billionaire intending to take control of the clubâs football operations. The 71-year-old has now passed the Premier League's Directors' and Owners' Test, the latest step for the deal being finalised. Man United had filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, which confirmed the Premier League's approval. The Premier League are expected to confirm this officially when the deal is fully completed.  Completion is expected next week with a couple of outstanding regulatory details still needing to be finalised. This includes receiving FA approval, which is required for Manchester United's participation in the Womenâs Super League. Ratcliffe's tender offer had initially been due to expire on Wednesday, but this has now been extended until Februay 17 as the process approaches a conclusion. The billionaire is buying 25 per cent of the Class B shares held by the Glazer family â which carry 10 times the voting rights of Class A shares â as part of his investment. Ratcliffe is also purchasing up to 25 per cent of Class A shares and investing Â£239m into the clubâs infrastructure. Ratcliffe and his INEOS team have already proved that they are not afraid to act - and make bold decisions in the process - such as with the decision to poach Omar Berrada from rivals Manchester City to become United's new CEO. The major coup - the first of the Ratcliffe-INEOS era - sees the highly-regarded exec move from cross-town rivals Manchester City. Mail Sport earlier revealed that Berradaâs arrival was driven by Sir Jim Ratcliffeâs INEOS team.   The club made a telling pledge upon the 46-year-old's appointment that alluded to concerns highlighted by supporters during the premiership of owners; the Glazer family. 'The Club is determined to put football and performance on the pitch back at the heart of everything we do,' the statement began. 'Omarâs appointment represents the first step on this journey'. Ratcliffe and Ineos director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford visited manager Erik ten Hag at the club's Carrington training ground at the start of January. The pair were also present at Old Trafford for Man United's 2-2 home draw against Tottenham last month. Ratcliffe pledged to give further insight into Ineos' plans for the club when his deal to secure 25 per cent of the club was approved.",Ratcliffe pledged to give further insight into Ineos' plans for the club when his deal to secure 25 per cent of the club was approved.

However one candidate appears to be making his desire to take the job as clear as day.  Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel could end up being an option if things continue to spiral in Bavaria â only if he is available for free will they move for him. Equally, Brighton manager Roberto de Zerbi is well-liked amongst the board of directors, but a rumoured release clause of â¬12-15m is seen as a large obstacle to his appointment, as per The Athletic, who say Barcelona do not want to fork out for their next coach. Former Bayern manager Hansi Flick on the other hand is making all of the right moves to be the next man in the dugout. Following reports that Flick wants the job and has started learning Spanish, he has now switched agents to Pini Zahavi. The Israeli representative has a good relationship with Barcelona and Joan Laporta, having brokered the Robert Lewandowski move two summers ago. As is pointed out, relationships have weighed heavily in Barcelonaâs recent business. Flick certainly meets the first requirement in terms of being available, and having a pedigree. Also working in his favour is the fact he has worked at Bayern, arguably the most similar club to the Blaugrana. However the lack of language skills, his success only coming with one side, and the fact that he has only operated in Germany work against him.","Flick certainly meets the first requirement in terms of being available, and having a pedigree.

Australia's captain and star Chelsea striker suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during Chelsea's warm weather training camp in January. On Tuesday, Kerr's teammate Millie Bright posted a promising social media update on the injury. Bright's Instagram story, captioned 'This makes me happy', showed a smiling Kerr walking in the physio room without crutches. Kerr reposted the clip on her own account and joked it was her 'max speed PB'.  The Matildas will next week travel to Uzbekistan for the first game of the third and final qualifying round before the Olympics in July. Kerr's father, Roger Kerr, spoke for many football supporters when he said it was 'sad news' that his daughter had again injured her knee. 'It was pretty disappointing, upsetting, so we [have] had a couple of restless nights,' he told Seven News. 'I think she's a bit numb. It's coming up to the Olympics and Olympic qualifiers in February. 'She had a sort of injured World Cup and now we were all looking forward and Australia was looking forward to the Olympics....it's sad news.' Mr Kerr added an ACL injury usually requires '12 months to get right', so 'hopefully in 2025 she can return to the pitch.' He then pointed to her significant workload, which sees her play more than 50 games a year - for Chelsea and Australia. As a unit, the Matildas need to quickly regroup - they face Uzbekistan over a two-legged play-off in February in a bid to qualify for the Olympics.  Kerr, who has often referenced how Cathy Freeman's 2000 Olympic gold medal inspired her as a youngster, featured at both the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.

329,Ronaldo used to argue with Mourinho about being subbed off - even when it's 5-0,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ronaldo-used-to-argue-with-Mourinho-about-being-subbed-off---even-when-its-5-0/3302222,1 day ago,"Jose Mourinho has revealed he used to argue with Cristiano Ronaldo when he wanted to substitute the star off at Real Madrid - but he was so talented he didn't need coaching.  Mourinho led the Bernabeu club between 2010 and 2013, with Ronaldo a major weapon as they took on Pep Guardiola's Barcelona. The Portuguese coach has told Rio Ferdinand's FIVE show it was impossible to tell Ronaldo to relax as he was so driven to accomplish more. 'You have guys like Cristiano, where you are playing against Levante and you are winning five-nil and you tell the guy to relax and take a rest,'  Mourinho said. 'No, no, no, I can score one more goal!' When you have guys like this, you know the boat is in the water and you just let the boat go and in the end you enjoy the fight.'  Mourinho was talking about the intense rivalry between his Real side and Guardiola's stylish Barcelona team which boasted Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta. In his first season, Real beat Barcelona 1-0 in the Copa del Rey final thanks to Ronaldo's towering header in extra time, before they pipped their rivals to the LaLiga title the following year. 'For us to win the league, we did 100 points. You knew that if you didn't do 98, 99, 100, you don't win it,' Mourinho added. 'You are then in trouble because Barcelona wins and the next season, the previous season, when Barcelona wins. I think we lost with 92 points or 91 points, something like that. 'So you know that if you made a mistake, you are in trouble.' Asked about what it was like to work with Ronaldo each day on the training ground, Mourinho said the player's natural abilities made him a dream to work with. 'I think you don't coach [him]. You don't teach much, it's about being happy and it's about creating an environment from the tactical point of view, from the ideas of football, where the player can show,' he said.   'Madrid for him was a little bit of a transition because for you he was a winger - left winger, right winger, dribbling, attacking people, beating people. 'In Madrid, he became more the goalscorer that he was for the rest of his career. 'In fact, probably the first time he played a big match as a striker was Real Madrid vs Barcelona in a cup final where he scored an amazing goal with an amazing header in extra time. 'Probably that was the first time people got the feeling that animal could be a goalscorer and not just a pure winger. 'Madrid was a bit of a hybrid because he was playing from the left but he was not wide and not chasing full-backs and we were protecting him with the balance being with Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira.  'That is the position when they can be more effective and score more goals. 'Cristiano, you know him as well as I do and almost in consecutive years. Motivation, you don't need to give him. Ambition, you don't need to give him. Technique, you don't need to give him. 'You give some tactical adjustments and let the guy be happy.'",'You give some tactical adjustments and let the guy be happy.'

It was Lionel Messi who clinched his eighth Ballon d'Or title after winning the men's award at the 2023 ceremony following his outstanding season leading Argentina to World Cup glory. Rodri, who also had a memorable season after winning the treble with Man City, was overlooked and finished fifth. As well as Messi, he was placed behind City team-mates Kevin De Bruyne, Erling Haaland as well as PSG star Kylian Mbappe. The Spanish international says he understands his position as 'marketing, money and advertising' play a role in deciding the winner of the prestigious award.   'I am not surprised.. This is normal. I understand very well how things work in these individual awards. They are based on marketing, money and advertising,' Rodri told the Mirror. 'There have been midfielders before who were also Spanish who did not get what they deserved. Do you understand what I mean? 'What ultimately matters to me in football Is what I achieved collectively.' As well as winning the treble last season, Rodri scored the vital goal which ensured City won their first Champions League title last June. Pep guardiola's side stand within the chance of repeating the historic feat once again this season.

331,The Premier League table since Arsenal hired Mikel Arteta in 2019,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/The-Premier-League-table-since-Arsenal-hired-Mikel-Arteta-in-2019/3300916,13 Feb,"Mikel Artetaâs Arsenal are currently on a tremendous run in the Premier League â but how does his Gunners record compare to their rivals since his appointment in December 2019?  Arsenal has enjoyed success in cup competitions, beating Chelsea 2-1 in the 2020 FA Cup final before winning the Community Shield in 2020 and 2023. But his side struggled for consistency in the Premier League during his first few years in charge, falling out of the top six and finishing two consecutive seasons in eighth place. However, the Gunners have looked like worthy title contenders for the last 18 months now and they currently sit just two points off the top of the table. Arsenalâs recent 6-0 hammering over West Ham especially highlights just how far the Gunners have come over these last few years. âWe are maintaining and building some momentum now, and the performances have been really strong, as well as the results in recent weeks,â Arteta told reporters. âWe need to maintain that because the other teams are doing it as well, we are not the only ones, and we need to recognise that. âAfter the Liverpool game, we have to show now that we have the capacity to replicate that level, or be better, and thatâs the way the boys trained the whole week.â Having won their last four league matches, Artetaâs men are on a tremendous run of form right now and thereâs every chance that they go all the way this season. Since the Spanish coach took the Arsenal job back in December 2019, only Liverpool and Manchester City have accumulated more points than the Gunners. If Arsenal want to win the league this season, they will be the two sides they need to finish above. Note: all teams have played 158 league games unless itâs stated otherwise. If teams are on equal points, the team that has played fewer games is positioned higher. If both parties have played the same number of matches, goal difference has been used to rank them. 1. Manchester City â 363 points (157 games played) 2. Liverpool â 332 points (159 games played) 3. Arsenal â 299 points 4. Manchester United â 286 points 5. Tottenham â 273 points (159 games played) 6. Chelsea â 253 points 7. Aston Villa â 227 points (157 games played) 8. Newcastle United â 220 points 9.

The France forward, who has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid, announced on Thursday that he will leave the Ligue 1 champions when his contract expires at the end of the season. Arteta feels that signing Mbappe would match Arsenalâs ambitions of becoming the âbest teamâ. When asked if Arsenal should be interested in the 25-year-old, Arteta said: âAbsolutely. Why not? If we want to be the best team then we are going to need the best talent and the best players for sure. âWhen there is a player of that calibre then we always need to be in the conversation but it looks like (his future) is in a different way.â Arteta says Arsenal are heading into the most important part of the season ahead of their Premier League clash with Burnley. The title-chasing Gunners currently sit third, two points behind leaders Liverpool, after extending their impressive run to four straight league wins following a dominant 6-0 victory at West Ham. Arteta highlighted the importance of claiming three points at Turf Moor and to keep up their consistent form during the final 14 league matches. âItâs the most important part of the season and every fixture will play a significant role in what we want to achieve,â Arteta said. âBurnley at the moment are a team which are extremely difficult to beat if you look at the results and how teams have drawn or beaten them by small margins. âThey are extremely well coached and are a team that are very competitive, so we know that we have a very tough match on Saturday and we need to play with the same energy and enthusiasm. âWe want to be there (title race) and it means we have done a lot right during the season. âWe have shown a big level of consistency in the team, we want to take a step forward and maintain the consistency.â Burnley, who sit seven points from safety, have struggled in their first season back in the Premier League. Arteta showed his admiration for Clarets manager Vincent Kompany, lauding his âspecial auraâ ahead of Saturdayâs clash. The Arsenal manager coached the former Manchester City captain when he was Pep Guardiolaâs assistant at the Etihad Stadium between 2016 and 2019. âWe know each other really well and I have huge respect for him, we had a really good relationship when we worked together,â Arteta added. Arsenal v Burnley â Premier League â Emirates Stadium  âI have a huge admiration for him when he was a player and he has a special aura around him. He has great ideas and a vision of how to play the game. âWhat they did in the Championship last season (winning the league by 10 points) was phenomenal in a record season. To do that you need to be exceptional (as a coach). âHe has courage and his work ethic is phenomenal.â",âHe has courage and his work ethic is phenomenal.â
333,Kane faces ANOTHER trophyless season after Bayern defeat by Leverkusen,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kane-faces-ANOTHER-trophyless-season-after-Bayern-defeat-by-Leverkusen/3301805,2 days ago,"When Harry Kane left Tottenham to join Bayern Munich, one thing appeared to be guaranteed - trophies.  The England captain even said himself that the Â£100m move to the Bundesliga giants was inspired by silverware, having yet to win a trophy during career. Unlike Tottenham, Bayern Munich appear to have a magnet to the game's big prizes. Since Kane was born, the club has only had three trophyless seasons - the last of which came in 2011-2012, when the now 30-year-old was still a teenager. Yet there appears to be a bitter irony that the Bundesliga title could be heading the way of Bayer Leverkusen - a team often given the lamentable nickname of 'Neverkusen', who have never won the Bundesliga title and last won a trophy in 1993. With Bayern Munich also failing in other competitions, the Champions League looks like Kane's best opportunity of ending his trophy drought and both he and his side desperately need a positive result as they head to Maurizio Sarri's Lazio on Wednesday night.    The ink had barely dried on his four-year contract when Kane missed out on his first piece of potential silverware as the Bavarians were thumped 3-0 by RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup. Kane could do nothing when the Bundesliga juggernauts crashed out in the German Cup to third division side FC Saarbrucken as the England captain was left on the bench. That was not a huge disaster for Kane as Bayern were still favourites for a 12th straight Bundesliga crown. Not any more. Their 3-0 defeat by Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend has left them five points off the top of the table.  There are still 13 games left to play in the Bundesliga, but the title is out of their hands and Xabi Alonso's side have not lost a game this season - and are on course to become the first ever invincibles in the German top-flight. It therefore leaves the Champions League as the last competition where Bayern Munich can say that their fate is completely in their hands, even if Manchester City and Real Madrid currently look like much stronger contenders. Kane has come close to tasting glory in Europe's most prestigious competition, reaching the final in 2019 with Tottenham before being beaten by Liverpool. It was a night where the England striker struggled and his performances in the biggest games have come under question in the past. He has lost four major finals, missed a crucial penalty in a World Cup knockout game, and finished second in the Premier League once and third on two occasions.    German media ripped into his performance against Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend, after he had just 18 touches of the ball. BILD described his performance as a 'catastrophe' with a headline reading: 'The Kane disaster.' It said 'he was actually brought in for games like this' and dubbed his display as his worst since his arrival last summer. Tuchel told reporters after the game that he had changed the formation from a 4-2-3-1 to a 3-4-2-1 for the game with Kane in mind. He said: 'It was rare for Harry to have so few touches. The formation was actually thought of with him in mind, but we didn't find him at all. We want to get Harry in the game more, and we need to fix it. 'I'm convinced we can show a reaction (against Lazio). It wasn't good enough in Leverkusen. But it's a new opponent, a new competition. I hope we can make up for it. It is clear Bayern Munich are not the same calibre of side that won the Champions League in 2020. They relied on a Borussia Dortmund collapse to win the Bundesliga title on the final day of the 2022-23 season and the likes of Thomas Muller, Joshua Kimmich and Manuel Neuer are not at the same level they were four years ago.  Alphonso Davies, Konrad Lamer and forwards Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman meanwhile are injured - and were big misses at the weekend. Despite all this, Kane's signing has undoubtedly been a successful one for Bayern Munich, as he has netted 28 goals in as many games in all competitions, including three hat-tricks. Kane has been the replacement to Robert Lewandowski that Bayern Munich needed, but it is the inconsistency around the rest of the team that is hurting them and made the German juggernaut look very beatable. Their 5-1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt, and a first defeat to Werder Bremen in 32 games between the sides show that things aren't quite right. Their defeat to Leverkusen has also increased the pressure on their manager Thomas Tuchel, even if the club's CEO has insisted that the former Chelsea boss will remain at the helm of the club. Tuchel won the Champions League during his time at Stamford Bridge and he and Kane will be determined to lift the trophy at Wembley on June 1. After cruising through their group they have been drawn with Italian side Lazio who are in the Champions League knockouts for only the third time. Sarri's side enjoyed a second-placed finish in Serie A last season but are languishing down in eighth - 23 points off leaders Inter Milan after a poor start to the season.    A 3-1 win against Cagliari at the weekend will have boosted morale ahead of the first leg against Bayern at the Stadio Olimpico - though the Italians have never won a Champions League in Germany. Tuchel's wounded Bayern Munich represent dangerous opponents for Lazio, though Sarri can take some confidence knowing that the German side are beatable, and that all the pressure is on their opponents to deliver. Ahead of the game, Sarri said: 'If we think it's impossible, we have already lost. 'We must have enthusiasm and self-confidence. It's a nice game which we want to win. We'll try to win it at all costs. 'When we have to suffer, we must do it together. There will be difficult moments but we must overcome them. It's inevitable against clubs like Bayern Munich. We must do the contrary of what we did against Inter in the Supercoppa. 'We should not forget that we are playing a game, so we must have fun.' Lazio can take inspiration from Villarreal, who knocked Bayern Munich out at the quarter-final stage two years ago despite only finishing seventh in the league. The fact the finished second last season shows there is still a dangerous side within Sarri's squad if they turn up, Ciro Immobile is the Serie A's eighth highest scorer of all time, with the likes of Felipe Anderson, Luis Alberto and Matteo Guendouzi also among their strongest players. Bayern Munich will still comfortably consider themselves as one of the favourites to win the Champions League (and Bundesliga) but with their chances fading away, Kane and his side can't afford any more slip-ups.","Bayern Munich will still comfortably consider themselves as one of the favourites to win the Champions League (and Bundesliga) but with their chances fading away, Kane and his side can't afford any more slip-ups."

Palmer joined Chelsea in a Â£40million move in the summer and his two stoppage-time assists aided Monday's 3-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. That was Palmer's 20th Premier League appearance for Chelsea - surpassing his total of 19 for City, most of which were made as a substitute. It was the 21-year-old England international's penalty which secured the point in Chelsea's 4-4 draw with City in November's reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge, and Palmer is bidding to have a big say in another classic this weekend. 'The manager helps us every day,' said Palmer, full of praise for Pochettino. 'It's little conversations, telling us what we need to do. He supports us massively so credit to the manager for keeping us all together. He's been amazing from the first day. 'When I first came in, he put his arm around me and gave me the freedom and confidence to go out there and play and I'm enjoying it. I came to Chelsea to get minutes and play week in, week out because obviously at City that wasn't happening. I came here to get an opportunity. I need to keep going and go up some more levels.' On whether Saturday will be his chance to show City why they were wrong to let him leave, Palmer said: 'I try to do that every game, so we'll see. It will be a tough game. But I am looking forward to going back. It will be strange and weird, but I'm looking forward to it and the team is.' Since losing 4-2 at home to Wolves, Chelsea have beaten Aston Villa in the FA Cup and Palace in the Premier League. It has alleviated the pressure on Pochettino's position, with Palmer insisting that he and his team-mates are totally behind their boss amid all the outside noise. 'There's always going to be a lot of talk,' Palmer said. 'You know what football fans are like and rightly so. Chelsea is a big club and we've seen them win many things for a long time. If we're not getting results, they are going to be on to us. 'But you've seen in the last two games that we are trying to stick together through our development as a team and keep going. Everyone is going to talk if you're not doing well. We just need to try and block it out, and focus on ourselves.'","'But you've seen in the last two games that we are trying to stick together through our development as a team and keep going.

Cat said: 'I do feel like I am married to the game. 'It changes a lot of thingsâ¦ your whole life revolves around the schedule of your partner but to another level because it's not a normal schedule where you can plan. Everything has to be planned around what's going on with them. 'You can't plan anything in advance unless it is in June. I am planning my wedding for next summer because J could possibly be in the Euros this year again so it will be next year. 'Even certain things like we have often had dinner planned with friends and if they lose a game, we have to cancel and I feel the worst but there's no way you can go out with someoneâ¦ after J has finished a game and they lost, there is no way I can talk to him for 24 hours. He is not in the mood.' Cat, who is a mum to daughter Ada, eight, from her relationship with Hollywood actor Jude Law, 51, and shares son Jax, three, with Jorginho, says she didn't win over her fiancÃ© by pretending to like football. In fact, Cat has only recently learned there are 11 players in a team and admits the rules of the game are still a mystery to her. She said: 'I am not crazy into football and I have never pretended that I am. I don't know anything about it. 'I love going to the games because it is a completely different atmosphere and it is different when you are at the game, you can feel the energy in the stadium, compared to when you are watching it at home.    'I don't watch football other than when he is playing. I don't know any of the rules, I don't know the offside rule, I don't know anythingâ¦ he tries to explain it to me. I honestly just learned there are 11 players.' Shortly after their engagement, the couple, who originally met on a dating app, moved into a new home in London's West Hampstead to be closer to Ada's school and Jorginho's training ground. Despite a hectic start to the year, Cat has already found her wedding dress and is planning to scope out venues in Italy ahead of their big day in the summer of 2025. She said: 'We got engaged on December 6 so right before Christmas. 'We had family over from Brazil afterwards, we had the kids here, we were so busy and then it was Christmas, then we went away and since we got back, we moved house. 'But I did say to J last night I think I'm going to go to Italy next month and start looking at venues. 'I think I have found my wedding dress but it is the second dress I have tried on so I probably need to go to some other shops.' Jorginho's commitment to the game, which has seen him win UEFA men's player of the year, means he is often apart from his family. The father-of-three, who also has a son and a daughter from his first marriage to Natalia Leteri, explained the biggest sacrifices are the special moments he misses with his children. Speaking on the show, he said: 'Everyone thinks football is happy and you have no problems, but we sacrifice a lot. 'The biggest one is being away all the time and not being close and missing many important moments... the kids growing up... it's not as easy as people think and that's the reality.'   Married to the Game viewers will have the chance to watch the Euro 2022 winner's romantic proposal, which Cat says has earned Jorginho bragging rights amongst his teammates. But making a TV moment of the intimate occasion wasn't Jorginho's intention as Cat reveals he's shy off the pitch and as a performer she's more outgoing in their relationship. She said: 'J didn't want to propose on camera, that's one thing he wanted to hold back on. 'He's actually a lot shyer than me especially when he doesn't know someone. He really takes time to analyse a situation and know what's going on, he's not very forward at first. 'But it felt absolutely amazing. I was expecting it but how he managed to trick me in the moment, it was a whole other thing. He put in so much work and he went above and beyond to make it special. He is quite something. 'He is now giving tips to other players and friends about how to do proposals.' Cat joins fellow WAGs Taylor Ward, who's married to Riyad Mahrez and Sara Gundogan, wife of Manchester City's midfielder Ilkay Gundogan on the series, which follows the glamorous lives of the women behind the footballers. And Cat hopes watchers will see there's more to the wives and girlfriends of Premier League players than luxury holidays, beautifying and designer bags, as she labels 'WAG' a 'stupid term.' She said: 'It is still used so much. It doesn't affect me that much, I laugh at it. 'I don't like it or think it's right. We have our own lives and do our own things, other wives and partners of the players are really successful women in their own right so I don't think it should be a term that is used to label them. 'But for me personally, I just let it goâ¦ it doesn't affect my life or how I feel about myself it's just a stupid term.'","'But for me personally, I just let it goâ¦ it doesn't affect my life or how I feel about myself it's just a stupid term.'"
337,Emile Smith Rowe opens up on Arteta's controversial Arsenal touchline antics,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Emile-Smith-Rowe-opens-up-on-Artetas-controversial-Arsenal-touchline-antics/3298987,11 Feb,"Emile Smith Rowe has admitted it feels like Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is ""on the pitch"" at times ahead of Sunday's London derby away at West Ham.  Arteta's touchline behaviour has long been a subject that evokes plenty of different opinions. Several prominent pundits have often questioned whether the Gunners manager should look to adopt a calmer approach when it comes to how he operates within his technical area. The conversation has reared its head once again recently after last Sunday saw Arteta sprint halfway up the touchline before returning to his bench as part of passionate celebrations following Leandro Trossard's late goal against Liverpool. Several key figures within the punditry scene made clear they felt the Arsenal manager was too emotional during games. However, it doesn't seem like his players agree. Smith Rowe discussed the way Arteta behaves during fixtures and made clear he had no problem with it. When asked what sets his boss apart, the Gunners ace told Sky Sports: ""I'd probably say his passion as well. ""Sometimes it just feels like he is on the pitch as well, I know other managers have passion as well but with him, it feels like he is the 12th man on the pitch."" Arteta himself also addressed the furore surrounding his celebrations when speaking to the media ahead of the clash against the Hammers on Sunday. He made clear that he feels he's not the only manager to celebrate wildly. ""I love it. I've seen managers at the Emirates on their knees, on the pitch,"" Arteta explained. ""I've seen very big managers walking onto the pitch, I've seen managers going across the touchline. I've seen that all in the Premier League. Personally, I love it because it brings such passion and emotion to the game. ""When it's done in a natural and unique way, I think it's great. It's my opinion and a lot of people may have something very different to mine."" It is unlikely that Arteta changes his approach when stood in his technical area at the London Stadium on Sunday. The Spaniard knows that after a weekend that has seen Manchester City and Liverpool win, Arsenal cannot afford a third defeat at the hands of West Ham this term. The first half of the season saw Arsenal beaten by their upcoming opponents in the Carabao Cup, with the Hammers running out 3-1 winners. Just shy of two months later, West Ham stunned the Emirates with a 2-0 away triumph. Arteta hasn't recorded a win in east London since May 2022, back when his Arsenal side were fighting to qualify for the Champions League rather than to win a first league title in two decades. Three points on Sunday would surely spark some emotional celebrations once again.","Arteta hasn't recorded a win in east London since May 2022, back when his Arsenal side were fighting to qualify for the Champions League rather than to win a first league title in two decades.

338,Jurgen Klopp denies swift returns have caused Liverpool injuries,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Jurgen-Klopp-denies-swift-returns-have-caused-Liverpool-injuries/3302846,5 hours ago,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has rejected suggestions he has rushed back players in recent weeks after Trent Alexander-Arnold, Thiago Alcantara and Dominik Szoboszlai all aggravated injuries early in their returns. Alexander-Arnold will miss the Carabao Cup final later this month because a knee problem recurred in last weekâs win over Burnley, Thiagoâs comeback after nine months lasted just 10 minutes, while Szoboszlai played just over an hour over two matches before succumbing to the hamstring problem which forced him to miss most of January. Mohamed Salah returned to training this week after a month out with a hamstring problem sustained on African Nations Cup duty with Egypt but Klopp is confident he is ready to play again. JÃ¼rgen Klopp today offered the latest fitness update on the squad, with Mohamed Salah set to return to action at Brentford  #BRELIV â Liverpool FC (@LFC) February 16, 2024 âMo is back in full training, that brings him automatically in contention of course,â said Klopp, who has just won his 10th manager of the month award, ahead of the lunchtime kick-off at Brentford. âI have to clarify a bit: I was not really aware of it but I got the news that there was a discussion we might have forced Trent back. He had two setbacks and it is really unfortunate, no one wants that. âI am here we never forced anyone back and never will do. But we work in a high-performance area and if you have the same injury you are fit after three days and another guy after four weeks. âWe always try to catch the earliest moment but when we catch that moment no one speaks about it, like with Macca (Alexis Mac Allister) recently and with Diogo (Jota). Thatâs a job we have to do. âThe last decision is always by the player but if you only listen to the player the player would play after two weeks and then it is a real problem. âThe boys were, in the moment when they played, fit but the (match) situation told us then differently because it happened again. âWe can never know if it would have happened anyway or whether it was something before. Very unlucky and unfortunate. âIt is not great but it says nothing about the quality of anyone. The world we are living in it is always immediately âMedical department? Iâm not sure about thatâ but it is nothing to do with that. âWe have to bring the boys as back as soon as possible but never sooner than they are ready from our point of view.â Klopp said the injuries to Alexander-Arnold and Szoboszlai were âseriousâ, with only the latter having a chance of making the cup final a week on Sunday. Trent Alexander-Arnold  âIt is a super-intense period. People think now about the final but before the final we have Brentford and Luton and I didnât think a second about the final yet,â he said. âItâs not âOh, he canât play the finalâ. Thatâs one game but before that we have two games which is as bad as they cannot play. âI think with Dominik it will be around that time and Trent maybe a week or two longer. I am not sure Dom has a chance for the final but maybe, and Trent will probably be after.â In addition to Salahâs return, Klopp has Ibrahima Konate back from suspension, Joe Gomez and goalkeeper Alisson Becker are fit again and Conor Bradley has returned from compassionate leave following the death of his father.","In addition to Salahâs return, Klopp has Ibrahima Konate back from suspension, Joe Gomez and goalkeeper Alisson Becker are fit again and Conor Bradley has returned from compassionate leave following the death of his father."
339,Kane's move to Bayern for trophies is in jeopardy after losing to Leverkusen,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kanes-move-to-Bayern-for-trophies-is-in-jeopardy-after-losing-to-Leverkusen/3299293,11 Feb,"You will know the pose. Head bowed, hands on hips, the haunting realisation a chance to finally become a winner had slipped away.  Harry Kane cut that figure in Moscow and Madrid, Wembley and Doha but he could never have foreseen adding Leverkusen to his destinations of despair. But here he was, shattered, confronting the prospect that another calamity is potentially unfolding. When Kane cut ties with Tottenham, we expected with good reason his medal famine would end. Bayern Munich always win the Bundesliga and had signed Englandâs captain for Â£100million - how could things go wrong? Well, things are certainly going wrong now. Bayern have time to extricate themselves from a situation that sees them trail Xabi Alonsoâs effervescent collective by five points but, watching them get ripped apart, you feared Kane will again be second best when the hints are given out in May. This was the kind of contest you expected to see him arriving into the penalty area with stealth, sweeping his right foot back and running off with that trademark celebration, a kiss of his left hand and a little jump in the air.   To stand a chance of doing that, though, he needed to see the ball â and he didnât. He got 18 touches over those brutal 95 minutes, when Alonso showed why many are ready to anoint him as Liverpool's next manager, and never mustered a shot. Kane's final contribution was an injury-time pass that rolled apologetically out of play. Kane, be absolutely clear, isnât the reason Bayern are floundering. His debut campaign in Germany, personally, has been excellent with 28 goals to date but he sought this challenge because he wanted more than individual recognition. He wanted to be a winner. But Bayern are out of the German Cup, face a tricky Champions League assignment against Lazio and this 3-0 defeat leaves them gasping for air in the quest to retain the Bundesliga title; worse for Kane, it seems that all is not well within in the camp. âTo be honest, Iâm ****ed off,â Thomas Muller fumed about the performance against Leverkusen. âWhat is missing from this team is balls. There has to be energy. It is not just about (looking at) the coach (Thomas Tuchel). Itâs about the players taking responsibility.â   Not a good sign. Perhaps Bayern will rouse themselves and Kane will get that opportunity to celebrate but to see him standing there so forlornly, you had to wonder whether history â for him at least â will repeat. All the momentum is with Alonso and his men, whose triumph was secured with goals from Josip Stanisic, Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong. âThe mentality (Alonso) has given us is that the season isnât over, itâs one win,â said Leverkusen defender Jonathon Tah. âWeâre in a good position but we must keep pushing. We enjoyed this, it was nice. Sometimes you have to stop and enjoy moments. But for the next game? We keep going.â Kane will do that too; he can only hope the rest of Bayern's listing squad will follow.",Kane will do that too; he can only hope the rest of Bayern's listing squad will follow.

RC Strasbourg Alsace secured a loan deal for Santos late in the transfer window, however, the midfielder, who spent the first half of the season on loan at Nottingham Forest, was away on international duty. Santos was competing in a qualification tournament for this summerâs Olympics in Paris, however, following Brazilâs elimination at the hands of Argentina on Monday, he has travelled back to France. Santos will undergo the formalities before signing the necessary paperwork on Wednesday. He is then expected to take part in his first training session with Les Alsaciens on Thursday morning. It is expected that he will be included in the Strasbourg squad to face FC Lorient on Sunday, where Patrick Vieiraâs side will be looking to bounce back after suffering successive defeats.

341,Abraham is nearing a first-team return after eight months out with an ACL injury,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Abraham-is-nearing-a-first-team-return-after-eight-months-out-with-an-ACL-injury/3301789,2 days ago,"Tammy Abraham is close to returning from an eight month knee injury lay-off in news that will alert Premier League clubs ahead of the summer transfer window.  Mail Sport understands the Roma centre forward is close to making his long-awaited return from an anterior cruciate ligament injury he suffered on the final day of last season. Abraham has returned to training and is approaching full fitness with a view to playing in Serie A within a matter of weeks. The 26-year-old enters the final two years of his current deal in the summer, a situation that a host of teams in England and Europe are acutely aware of. Whether clubs are prepared to advance their interest in Abraham will largely depend on how he performs once he finally makes his playing return.  But the fact a number of clubs are on the look out for a striker this summer makes Abraham an intriguing proposition. His role under a new-look coaching team following the departure of Jose Mourinho, who brought Abraham to the Italian capital in 2021 for Â£34million, is also likely to be a factor in his future. Daniele De Rossi, who replaced Mourinho, is the current head coach but has only signed a deal until the end of the season. Abraham scored 27 goals for Roma in his first season at the club, helping the Italian side win the Europa Conference League. The former Chelsea striker notched nine times under Mourinho last season - but is yet to make an appearance this season due to injury.  Manchester United and former club Chelsea were both credited with an interest in Abraham last year before he suffered his serious knee injury. It remains to be seen whether Roma would entertain losing Abraham but a return to England may suit the centre forward following three years in Italy.",It remains to be seen whether Roma would entertain losing Abraham but a return to England may suit the centre forward following three years in Italy.
342,Hojlund says Rashford and Bruno may be the best players he's ever played with,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hojlund-says-Rashford-and-Bruno-may-be-the-best-players-hes-ever-played-with/3302164,1 day ago,"Rasmus Hojlund could not choose between two of his current Manchester United team-mates when asked who is the best player he has ever played with.  The 21-year-old made a slow start to life in the Premier League following his Â£72million signing from Italian side Atalanta last summer. But with five goals in his last five league outings, it is clear the talented youngster has the ability to cut it in the English top-flight. Since joining, Hojlund has taken to the field with a raft of quality performers, while there are also a host of top players featuring alongside him on international duty for Denmark. Of all the star names the striker settled on Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford when asked who his best-ever team-mate is, unable to decide between the pair.  'In terms of ability?' He inquired in a JD Football video on TikTok. 'Probably Marcus [Rashford] or Bruno [Fernandes]' Given his age and limited experience at the top level, the striker had a relatively small pool of players to choose from compared to some of his Old Trafford colleagues. Fernandes himself appeared in the video and replied to the question with his former United and Portugal team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.  As did Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who also played alongside the five-time Ballon d'Or winner during his ill-fated 18 months spell back at the club. 'It's because of his work ethic,' Wan-Bissaka explained as to why he had chosen the 39-year-old. 'The way he carries himself and his mentality.'","'It's because of his work ethic,' Wan-Bissaka explained as to why he had chosen the 39-year-old. 'The way he carries himself and his mentality.'"
343,Sir Dave Brailsford laughs off question about Man United signing Kylian Mbappe,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Sir-Dave-Brailsford-laughs-off-question-about-Man-United-signing-Kylian-Mbappe/3302667,17 hours ago,"Sir Dave Brailsford made light of a question about Manchester United signing Kylian Mbappe as he suggested the forward wants to move to Real Madrid.  PSG confirmed on Thursday that Mbappe will leave the club when his contract expires in June. Real Madrid have been given the green light to try and sign the French dynamo after seven years of courting him and are favourites to land his signature. However, one young fan couldn't resist asking Brailsford - INEOS' director of sport, who will be influential at Old Trafford - whether United would sign him. Brailsford's answer isn't fully audible, but he appears to say that Mbappe is 'set on going to Real Madrid'.  His admission, made with a smile, is perhaps an admission that United might struggle to ensnare Mbappe against the great pull that Madrid have. United have been linked with him in the past but are not in the same position to challenge for trophies as Madrid. Madrid's protracted pursuit of Mbappe has left them frustrated and embarrassed and they wanted a public show from Mbappe that he intended to leave the French club this time before making their move. Mbappe's decision not to renew leaves the path clear for the La Liga leaders to close the signing. It has also been interpreted as a clear signal Mbappe is prepared to drop his financial demands. Fourteen-time European Cup winners Madrid have always maintained they would not compete financially with PSG. The Spanish club's unwillingness to smash their wage structure to match the Â£21.4million annual salary the Frenchman earns in Paris after tax is no longer a problem, as there would be no transfer fee to pay. Mail Sport understands Madrid are willing to make Mbappe the club's top earner, surpassing the Â£10.3m per season they pay Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior. They will also pay a signing-on fee of around Â£85.5m and open talks over what percentage of his image rights he retains.   The player's mother Fayza Lamari wants Madrid to abandon their usual 50-50 split between club and player and Madrid president Florentino Perez is likely to cede to those demands. Mbappe is expected to take the No 10 shirt that Luka Modric will vacate in the summer. His arrival would give Madrid a forward line of Mbappe, Vinicius and Rodrygo, supported by Bellingham. Last summer PSG received a world-record Â£259m bid from Al Hilal for Mbappe and gave the player permission to talk to the Saudi club. However, it was reported Mbappe turned down the chance to even discuss a move to Al Hilal when delegates from the club came to Paris. During his time in Paris, Mbappe has gone on to return a staggering 243 goals in 290 appearances for the club, netting his 44th goal Champions League goal on Wednesday night. Yet, it seemed as though his time at PSG had been nearing its end for a while now, with tensions rising in recent years with both the club and the player butting heads on his contract with the club. PSG had wanted him to extend his deal past 2025, but banished him to train with the B team, after Mbappe refused to sign a contract extension. That stand-off intensified after the club prevented Mbappe from attending their tour of Japan - with the club subsequently dropping the 25-year-old from all advertising.   The signs back then were perhaps telling, with Mbappe writing a letter to the Parisian outfit stating that he would not be activating a year-long extension clause in his contract. As tensions flared, PSG accused Mbappe of inflicting 'a lasting paralysis on the club' and stated that he should have treated the club better after their 'years of unprecedented goodwill and commitment' to him. For Mbappe, the next six months will be a busy one, in many ways. He will no doubt be wanting to finish his time at PSG by winning the Champions League. After that comes the Euros, with Mbappe set to lead Didier Deschamps' team at the tournament. Henry has also said that he would love to have Mbappe as part of his side that will represent France at the Olympics in Paris later this summer. But there is no doubt several clubs around Europe will be eyeing up a move for the French superstar.",But there is no doubt several clubs around Europe will be eyeing up a move for the French superstar.

It will be Laporta and Sporting Director Deco who will have to decide on the new direction of matters in Catalonia, and without Xavi to handle most of the criticism, if things continue to go wrong from here, it will be their necks on the line.  According to Sport, Laporta is made a curious move towards the end of the January transfer window, which finished on the 1st of February, but it wasnât for a player. Laporta was spotted in Palma de Mallorca, and they claim a meeting took place in a restaurant called El Portitxol with former Director of Football Mateu Alemany. The purpose was to persuade Alemany to come back to the club, after he was forced out in August to make room for Sporting Director Deco, who wanted full power over transfers. It is not clear what exact role Alemany would have had, but he rejected Laportaâs offer outright. He has been linked with a position at Atletico Madrid and to the presidency of the Spanish Football Federation, but had no plans to return to the Blaugrana. The natural assumption is that Laporta feels Barcelona are missing his expertise â Alemany oversaw the construction of the squad that won La Liga last season. The former Valencia sporting director originally planned to leave for Aston Villa last April, but that move fell apart due to disagreements with Unai Emery. By the time he had changed his mind, moves had been made to bring Deco in already, who desired full control.","The natural assumption is that Laporta feels Barcelona are missing his expertise â Alemany oversaw the construction of the squad that won La Liga last season.

The Portuguese coach won the Europa Conference League with the Italian club in 2022 and then guided them to last season's Europa League final. But he was sacked by owners Dan and Ryan Friedkin on January 16 with Roma sitting a lowly ninth in the Serie A standings. Mourinho, 61, said he chose Roma after turning down the opportunity to coach the Portugal national team and also in Saudi Arabia. 'I can say it was the one [exit] that has hurt me the most,' Mourinho, who is a Football.com global ambassador, told Rio Ferdinand's FIVE show.   'I gave everything, I gave my heart, I gave even some options that could be considered not very clever from the professional point of view. 'I refused some great working opportunities. The first one was very hard to refuse because it was Portugal national team, probably the best Portugal national team ever and three years before a World Cup. 'Then I had a big one from Saudi and I didn't hide it at the time because it was really big. 'I did it - normally I a very pragmatic in my choices, very professional in my choices and I try to be very emotionally controlled and you could see that when I left other clubs after winning finals. 'In this case I was not pragmatic, I was emotional and I gave everything. So in the end when I left, I left hurt. I had the great feeling that I gave so much happiness to the people. 'Two European finals in a row doesn't happen too often, especially in a club like Roma which doesn't have a big history of European success.   'Then I was walking in the street and the people were like ""take us to Dublin, take us to Dublin"" [for this year's Europa League final] and so I had that in my mind, the third European final in a row. 'But you have to respect, the owner is always the owner. It's not the first time I left a club, it is probably the first time I am feeling it in a different way. 'You move on, you try to learn from the experience be better for the next one.'

Ferran Torres and Joao Felix were both ruled out within the space of a few days, missing multiple weeks with their injuries, and Diario AS say that their slim chances of making it back for the Napoli game are dwindling even further. Felix was more likely to recover from his ankle sprain, and there had been some talk of a pain-killing injection in Can Barca, but that option is now ruled out. Meanwhile Torresâ hamstring tear will also keep him sidelined. Neither are necessarily ruled out for their clash against Getafe the following weekend. He will have some extra depth, with Sergi Roberto and Oriol Romeu both expected to be back by next Wednesday. Neither are likely to start, with midfield being the heaviest competition in the Barcelona squad. Further forward, Brazilian winger Raphinha is easing his way back from his own hamstring problem, and did see minutes against Granada on Sunday. He played on the left, as an auxiliary left-back, which could suggest that Xavi might use him on that side against Napoli. Lamine Yamal is their most dangerous player currently, and both play the same position, although Xavi could opt for a fourth midfielder instead of using one of them out of position.","Further forward, Brazilian winger Raphinha is easing his way back from his own hamstring problem, and did see minutes against Granada on Sunday.

348,Mahrez & Fabinho's partners loving life in Middle East but Mane's still studying,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mahrez--Fabinhos-partners-loving-life-in-Middle-East-but-Manes-still-studying/3301808,2 days ago,"Over the past 12 months, there has been a significant rise in the number of footballers departing Europe to play in Saudi Arabia.  And who can blame them? With astronomical amounts of money on offer, many have found it difficult to turn down the opportunity. But it can't all be about money. Players also have other things to consider when pondering a move to the Middle East, and whether the switch would work for their partner is likely to be top of their priority list. Many wives and girlfriends (WAGs) have joined their partners in Saudi, but not all have taken the plunge yet. Mail Sport takes a look at the WAGs of some of football's biggest stars to have moved across the globe recently. Let's start with the player credited with getting the ball rolling when it comes to players joining the Saudi Pro League - Cristiano Ronaldo. The global superstar joined Al-Nassr in December 2022 on a Â£175m-a-year contract, and immediately started living with his girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez, and their children, despite Saudi law prohibiting couple that are not married from living with one another. Ronaldo and Rodriguez were given an exemption, and appear to be enjoying their time in a new country. They posted photos on Instagram last year showing off their lavish home with a swimming pool and their impressive car collection. There is no indication that they are considering leaving Saudi Arabia behind any time soon.    Riyad Mahrez and his wife, Taylor Ward, recently appeared on a new reality TV show called Married to the Game that will air later this month, and one clip from the show has gone viral as it showed Ward in floods of tears after her husband revealed he would be moving to Saudi Arabia. The British model could not have been less convinced by the idea at the time, but appears to have come around to it over time. Speaking exclusively to Mail Sport recently, Ward confirmed she had finally moved out to Jeddah after several trips back and forth to England since his summer switch, and she has been pleasantly surprised by her new surroundings. 'So far, the experience has been amazing,' she said. 'There's obviously no alcohol so I won't be having a glass of wine! To be honest, there's more there than I originally thought. When I went on my first trip, I saw a Nando's. I was just like ""I'm so happy they've got Nando's"". 'The vibe is just very different. It's a lot more chilled out there, it's quieter and calmer, whereas in Manchester life is so busy - there's so much going on and we're always going out for dinner and seeing friends. That's probably what I'm missing the most, seeing family and friends rather than what the country is missing. 'The people have been so lovely - I think that was actually a massive shock, how nice everyone has been. You can't compare it to the UK - it's nothing like here. I'm enjoying it so far, it just feels like I'm on holiday, I don't feel like I've moved there yet.'   Former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves has been one of the main success stories on the pitch since moving to Saudi Arabia, with his team Al-Hilal seven points clear at the top of the table and yet to lose in the league this season. And things are also going well for him off the pitch, with his wife, Debora Lourenco, loving life after leaving England behind. Lourenco posted an Instagram story of her daughter riding a bike shortly after their move last summer alongside the caption: 'We live in a place where we can give them all the freedom and make friends from all over the world. How nice to see them grow up like this.' She has continued to post photos of herself enjoying her time in Saudi Arabia, indicating that she has been won over by the country already.  Fabinho left Liverpool after five years at the club last summer and now plays for Al-Ittihad. His wife, Rebeca Tavares, a former footballer herself, and their son Israel also live with him in Saudi Arabia, and have settled quickly. Tavares has been outspoken on social media in the past, famously aiming a dig at Manchester City after thousands of Liverpool fans flocked the streets just 24 hours after they lost the 2022 Champions League final to celebrate their team's success that season. But she has not complained at all about moving to a new country, and looks to have embraced the Saudi culture. She posted a photo of herself out on the streets in December with the caption: 'Historic district, Jeddah'.   Franck Kessie has enjoyed plenty of success on the pitch in recent years, winning league titles with AC Milan and Barcelona, before leading Ivory Coast to Africa Cup of Nations glory on Sunday, as he scored in the final against Nigeria. Things are also going well for him off the pitch with his wife, Sira, giving birth to their fourth child towards the end of 2023. Sira's Instagram highlights her interest in hair and beauty as she has posted a number of videos of herself getting ready for major events. But she has also taken the time to watch her husband in action for his new team Al-Ahli this term, with Kessie netting six goals in 19 league appearances.  Karim Benzema is reportedly unhappy in Saudi Arabia after only moving there a little over six months ago, but he was unable to get a move away in January. His girlfriend, Jordan Ozuna, is a full-time model after previously working as a Hooters waitress in Las Vegas, and she does not appear to have moved to Saudi Arabia on a permanent basis yet. Ozuna, who had a child with Benzema last year, has regularly attended fashion shoots in European hotspots including Madrid and Paris in recent months so has not joined Benzema in Jeddah. Benzema was also seen cosying up with his ex-wife, Chloe de Launay, while on holiday in Mauritius last month. Benzema and De Launay have two children together from their past relationship.  Roberto Firmino and Larissa Pereira tied the knot back in Brazil in 2017, and now have four children together. Like Benzema, Firmino's time in Saudi Arabia has not been a particularly happy one and he was linked with a return to England last month. But he has had Pereira by his side to get through the difficult moments, and she posted a loved-up photo of the pair on a day out in Jeddah towards the end of last year. Whether Firmino remains in the Middle East beyond this season remains to be seen, but there have been few complaints from Pereira thus far.  Former Liverpool star Sadio Mane, 31, married Aisha Tamba, 19, last month shortly before the Africa Cup of Nations. They did not have long to celebrate the day, though, as Tamba returned to her school in Senegal the following day where she is currently studying ahead of some key exams this summer.  Mane teamed up with Ronaldo at Al-Nassr last summer and has 12 goals in all competitions for the club, but his new wife is yet to settle in his new environment with him. This could change once she finishes her exams later this year, with Mane contracted to Al-Nassr until 2026.","This could change once she finishes her exams later this year, with Mane contracted to Al-Nassr until 2026."
349,Toni Kroos infuriates fans with refereeing comments following UCL controversy,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Toni-Kroos-infuriates-fans-with-refereeing-comments-following-UCL-controversy/3301630,2 days ago,"Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos has given the clamouring RB Leipzig and Barcelona fans further fuel for their frustration following another controversial decision in favour of Los Blancos. Kroos admitted that RB Leipzigâs goal in the second minute, disallowed for offside interference, should have stood.  The game had barely started when Benjamin Sesko appeared to beat the offside trap and head home for the opener, giving Leipzig the perfect start. However after a VAR review, it was determined that the contact with goalkeeper Andriy Lunin from an offside Leipzig player was interfering with the Ukrainian. After the match, Carlo Ancelotti dismissed controversy over the goal, saying it was clearly offside, but Kroos was not of the same mind. During the TV broadcast it was put to Kroos that it âdid not favour footballâ to disallow such goals, as carried by Marca. âAt half-time we talked a lot about what happened in minute 2, Leipzigâs goal, which was disallowed. It wasnât offside. There was a little push to the goalkeeper. I donât know if youâve seen it already. I donât think this is âIt favors football. This is not a question of whether it is a goal in favor of Leipzig, I simply think it is a legal goal. How do you see it?â Kroos agreed that he would rather the goal had stood. âI see it the same way. I think in the end he called offside because it got in his way, but the goalkeeper couldnât reach the ball and thatâs why the goal had to be given. You canât argue any other way,â Kroos sentenced. Refereeing analyst Antonio Mateu Lahoz claimed it was âmadnessâ to disallow the goal on Spanish TV coverage, but the letter of law does state that if Luninâs ability to play the ball is impacted, even if he cannot make a play on the ball, then it is offside. Utimately, it is such a tight decision that it could have been given either way, but what seems to be clear, based on Kroosâ comments at least, is that the law needs adjusting to take into account when the goalkeeper is left redundant.","Utimately, it is such a tight decision that it could have been given either way, but what seems to be clear, based on Kroosâ comments at least, is that the law needs adjusting to take into account when the goalkeeper is left redundant."
350,Stats show Spurs score MORE goals per game & have a better win-rate without Kane,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Stats-show-Spurs-score-MORE-goals-per-game--have-a-better-win-rate-without-Kane/3302417,18 hours ago,"It's fair to say that Harry Kane and his Bayern Munich team-mates have endured a five-day period from hell.  After a dismal display against Bundesliga title rivals Bayer Leverkusen - which saw them get beaten 3-0 - Thomas Tuchel's side then lost a crucial Champions League clash with Lazio. After both games, ex-Tottenham star Kane was slammed by German media outlets for his lack-lustre performances in-front of goal - as he failed to score in either tie. While the England captain continues to come under scrutiny, over in north London, things haven't looked better for years as Ange Postecoglou continues to develop his youthful Spurs side. Here, Mail Sport takes a look at what the stats say about Tottenham and Bayern's fortunes both with and without the England talisman.  To begin our analysis of Kane and his influence on the pitch, let's begin with the statistics regarding his former club Tottenham. During the 2022-23 campaign, the England captain provided a staggering 30 Premier League goals as the north London outfit secured an eighth place finish. While Kane had been part of a defensive-minded Antonio Conte side, Tottenham have looked reinvigorated under current boss Ange Postecoglou. The Australian has had an unprecedented impact on the north London side and, even without the club's top goalscorer of all-time, has managed to change their fortunes. Stats, provided by Opta Stats Perform, show that in 2022-23 Tottenham averaged 1.64 goals per game, with an expected goal tally of 1.42 in all competitions. Now, without Kane, Spurs are averaging 1.96 per game, with an average expected goal tally of 1.66, which serves as a testament to their new free-flowing football. In place of Kane, the likes of Son Heung-min, Richarlison and Brennan Johnson have all stepped up with goal contributions for the north London outfit. They also boast an increased rate of shots per game - 13.4 from 2022-23 compared to 15.1 now - and shots on target per game - 4.9 last year compared to 5.7 this year.    Perhaps the most crucial stat of all, the club's win-rate, also falls in favour of Spurs' 2023-24 side - with the 55.6 per cent rate bettering last year's 46 per cent. Meanwhile, German giants Bayern have endured far different fortunes this season and look likely to miss out on any silverware in 2023-24. They trail rivals Leverkusen by five points in the league and have been knocked out of the DFB Pokal - meaning the Champions League perhaps represents the most viable trophy to win. During the last campaign - which saw them win the Bundesliga title - Bayern averaged 2.73 goals per game in the league. However, with Kane in their ranks they now average just 2.45 goals per game. This stat comes as an even greater shock considering that Kane has managed to score 28 goals in the German top-flight from just 29 appearances.   However, the Englishman's goals certainly do help them boast a better expected goal per game record than the previous campaign - with the current rate of 2.32 bettering last year's total of 2.24. They also average marginally fewer shots in total (18.4 per game last year compared to 18.3 this year) while the Bavarians have fallen drastically in their shots on target per game. In 2023-24, Bayern have averaged 6.9 shots on target per game which is a dramatic fall off from their 7.9 average last term. However, despite all of this, Bayern actually boast a higher win-rate this season than they did last. In 2022-23, they had a win rate of 67.3 per cent while this year, it is 71 per cent.","However, despite all of this, Bayern actually boast a higher win-rate this season than they did last.

Griezmann is enjoying a superb second spell in Madrid with the France star now the clubâs leading goal scorer. However, his place in the supporters affection has been a had fought battle, following his return from Catalonia. Griezmann rejoined Atletico Madrid initially on loan in 2021, before completing a permanent switch in 2022. The attacker admitted he needed to work hard to prove his worth to the Los Rojiblancos supporters and the circle has been completed in recent months. Griezmann was presented with golden ring by his teammates and club officials as part of an official ceremony to mark his goal record.  As part of wide ranging interview at the ceremony, Griezmann was asked about his time at Barcelona, from 2019 to 2021. He opted to eventually leave Madrid, after rejecting a 2018 switch, and in recollection it was a decision he regrets. âI decided to leave because I had reached my mental limit. I had to leave, and you always think that outside is betterâ, as per quotes from Marca. âI wanted to try, but after a few months, I realised I was not as happy as in Madrid and at Atleti. âI was angry with myself and I had to work hard, and be quiet. I became âsmallâ for the first few months back here. â(Fernando) Torres told me when I came back that if I left everything on the field the fans would respect me. âItâs a joy to be here, I made a mistake, as can happen to anyone, but I will do everything so the fans are proud of their No.7. We need you from now to the end of the season, thanks for the love, and we will enjoy it together.â","âItâs a joy to be here, I made a mistake, as can happen to anyone, but I will do everything so the fans are proud of their No.7.

352,Liverpool fans slam the club's medical team as Arnold suffers new injury setback,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Liverpool-fans-slam-the-clubs-medical-team-as-Arnold-suffers-new-injury-setback/3301859,1 day ago,"Liverpool fans have taken to social media to question the club's medical team amid the high number of injuries hitting the senior squad.  On Wednesday, it emerged that Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to miss the Carabao Cup final at the end of the month after aggravating a knee injury in the win over Burnley. He joins Dominik Szoboszlai and Thiago Alcantara in aggravating injuries, and missing games at a crucial time of Liverpool's season as they fight on four fronts. Szoboszlai suffered his own setback when he played against Chelsea on January 31, as he returned from a hamstring issue, before Thiago sustained a muscle injury against Arsenal on February 4 on his first game back after injury. Fans on X (formerly Twitter) felt that the Liverpool medical team had to change their ways due to the escalating number of recurring injuries.   One noted: 'It really is not a good look on Liverpoolâs medical team the fact Trent, Szoboszlai and Thiago are all injured so quickly after returning from injury. 'Trent and Szoboszlai are the major concerns especially as itâs the same injury thatâs reoccurred so quickly.' Another added: 'Questions need to be asked about Liverpoolâs medical team. Theyâre rushing people back from injuries and constantly underestimates the length of these injuries. 'âWill be out for three weeksâ quickly turns into six/seven. It happens time and time again.' 'Liverpool medical team need investigation man, wtf are these injuries so ridiculous,' wrote a third, while another said: 'Liverpool FC have to fire their medical team by the way. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dominik Szoboszlai aggravating injuries is a disgrace.'       Alexander-Arnold, Szoboszlai and Thiago are not the only injury issues currently affecting Liverpool's first team. Joel Matip sustained an ACL injury in December, with no timescale placed on his recovery, while Mo Salah sustained a muscle injury whilst on international duty with Egypt at AFCON last month. The injured players create a selection headache during a busy period for Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. Liverpool travel to Brentford on Saturday, host Luton Town next Wednesday, and then go into the League Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley on February 25.","Liverpool travel to Brentford on Saturday, host Luton Town next Wednesday, and then go into the League Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley on February 25."

Juve sit seven points behind league leaders Inter Milan, who have a game in hand, and are in search of their first win in four attempts following losses to Udinese and the table-toppers, which came after a 1-1 draw with Empoli that saw Arkadiusz Milik sent off in the 18th minute. Verona sit third-from-bottom with four wins in 24 matches but, with just six points separating 19th-placed Cagliari from Lecce in 13th, will be desperate to gain any advantage on fellow relegation-threatened clubs. pic.twitter.com/XwbEUkPyr9 â JuventusFC  (@juventusfcen) February 15, 2024 Allegri told a press conference: âWeâve earned a point in two games at home and thatâs not good, tomorrow will be a complicated away match, Verona are in a difficult situation but are doing well. We need to work on our attitude not only in terms of performance, but above all in terms of attention to detail. âOur performances have not been worse, even on a numerical level, but we must analyse everything, beyond the result. Against Udinese, we made a mistake on an inactive ball and we were punished, this is football. Details are important. âWe have to learn what didnât go well over the last few games. The performances were good and we have to start from there. The management will then work to strengthen the team for next year, because we hope to play many more matches.â Allegri revealed he will have âeveryone availableâ for the trip to Verona and, while forward Federico Chiesa has been linked to a summer transfer to the Premier League, emphasised that the 26-year-old will be âvery important to us for the rest of the season.â Federico Chiesa is a rumoured summer transfer target for several Premier League clubs  Juventus have not won a trophy since lifting the Coppa Italia in 2021, but the boss was confident hisÂ  side are on the right trajectory, remaining one point clear of third-placed AC Milan and with an 11-point advantage over Atalanta in the fourth Champions League place.

354,Xavi Hernandez response suggests Deco dishonesty within Barcelona camp,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Xavi-Hernandez-response-suggests-Deco-dishonesty-within-Barcelona-camp/3300759,12 Feb,"Barcelona Sporting Director Deco is amongst the headlines today, after he seemingly called for a change in the model of play that has seen Barcelona win all five of their European Cups. Those comments have since been denied, but if Decoâs original statements are to be believed, Xavi Hernandezâs response to them paints an even more concerning image of Can Barca than is already drawing criticism.  Deco told Portuguese magazine Nascer do Sol that the Blaugrana need a change from âan exhausted modelâ, and needed to find someone to give them a âbreak with the past once and for allâ. Despite the interview occurring in his native language, and the statements being up for several days, NdS and Deco have since claimed this was a misunderstanding, and he was referring to their spending and not their style of play. Given Deco is now due to give a public statement on the matter, it shows that they are concerned about the impact of the words, in a story that continues to become more and more curious. That is added to by Xavi being asked about those words, to which he responded that Deco had been telling him differently in private. âItâs not what he communicates to me. He believes in the Barca model and DNA, and he has also played here. I canât say anything more, I donât know,â he told Sport. It will be impossible to tell whether Deco did or didnât mean what he was quoted saying, but if his original statements are taken at face value, then itâs highly concerning that he is thinking one thing and telling Xavi another. Deco and Xavi have always maintained that they have a good relationship since the former returned to the club, but undoubtedly the two have not appeared to be on the same page in recent months, and that tallies with the end of Decoâs spell as a player. The two did not see eye-to-eye at the time, and now there is at the very least a suggestion that the old rift continues to exist.","Deco and Xavi have always maintained that they have a good relationship since the former returned to the club, but undoubtedly the two have not appeared to be on the same page in recent months, and that tallies with the end of Decoâs spell as a player.

355,Roy Keane reveals the one reason he KNEW Gary Neville was going to name Maguire,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Roy-Keane-reveals-the-one-reason-he-KNEW-Gary-Neville-was-going-to-name-Maguire/3300680,12 Feb,"Roy Keane implied Gary Neville has a bias when selecting the player of the match after Man United's win against Aston Villa.  Erik ten Hag's side picked up what could prove to be a vital victory at Villa Park and in doing so moved themselves within six points of fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League football. Harry Maguire started alongside Raphael Varane in United's seemingly ever-rotating defence and had an immediate impact, winning a header from a corner to find Rasmus Hojlund. The young forward has been prolific since finally opening his Premier League account on Boxing Day, and he netted to give the visitors the lead after 17 minutes. Andre Onana produced one of his best performances to date in a Manchester United shirt throughout the first half, producing two crucial saves to maintain their lead into the interval.  Villa were persistent though, and their efforts were rewarded when Douglas Luiz equalised on the hour mark. Scott McTominay has been in a rich vein of form in front of goal this season and the Scotsman duly delivered to secure victory in dramatic fashion. Neville named Maguire the Player of the Match for his efforts, and while Keane admitted the England international was solid at the heart of defence, he insisted some partisanship on behalf of the former United defender could be at play. 'I thought he did alright today, obviously some lads give defenders Man of the Match because they've been defenders themselves - that type of scenario. It was definitely going to be a defender.' Keane said on Sky Sports. Asked who he would've chosen in place of Maguire for the award the former Republic of Ireland international continued: 'No big deal about that but we've praised the defenders considered the amount of chances Villa had. 'Winning Man of the Match the bottom line is it's no big deal, what's important for Maguire is he's getting games under his belt and he's getting back up to speed. 'He's a good, solid, experienced defender. The problems are still there for Man United, they got away with it today because the attacking players are scoring goals.' Maguire has enjoyed a renaissance at United in recent weeks particularly given how bleak his future at the club appeared this summer. Amid significant discotent across the club's fanbase, the 30-year-old was stripped of the captaincy in July, and, like McTominay, was repeatedly linked with a move to West Ham having fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford.    A series of injuries provided an opportunity to return to first-team action however, and the former Hull City star made nine consecutive league starts before being curtailed with an injury of his own in December. Since then though Maguire has returned to action in good form, and has featured in the club's last three Premier League games. With eleven Premier League starts this campaign Maguire has already surpassed his tally for the previous season, and Lisandro Martinez's recent injury likely provide him with an extended spell in the starting XI.","With eleven Premier League starts this campaign Maguire has already surpassed his tally for the previous season, and Lisandro Martinez's recent injury likely provide him with an extended spell in the starting XI."
356,Saka says he's not sure he can be happy despite surpassing a historic milestone,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Saka-says-hes-not-sure-he-can-be-happy-despite-surpassing-a-historic-milestone/3300329,12 Feb,"Arsenal supporters have heaped praise on Bukayo Saka after he became the youngest player in more than 40 years to reach 50 goals for Arsenal.  William Saliba gave the Gunners the lead against West Ham, and once the floodgates had been opened Mikel Arteta's side were relentless in front of goal. Saka reached the milestone from the penalty spot on 41 minutes before Gabriel and Leandro Trossard made it 4-0 at the interval. The 22-year-old added a second goal after the restart with Declan rice joining the rout against his former club by capping off the victory with a stunning goal at the London Stadium. Despite such an emphatic victory, Saka reflected after the game that Arsenal could have had more if they had been more clinical.  'We were four nil up in the first half and could have scored many more, including myself. I think today we smelled blood, we went for the kill. 'We did really well to score more. I'm really happy to achieve that (50 Arsenal goals). But I'm not sure I can be happy today. 'I missed some chances I thought I could have scored. It's a great achievement. I'm proud of that.' After the game, Arsenal fans pointed to Saka's frustration at failing to convert even more chances in the victory as evidence of the England international's relentless mindset. One supporter wrote: 'Bukayo Saka scored a brace which took him to both 50 goals and a total of 100 goal contributions for Arsenal but heâs still unsatisfied because he missed a clear chance in the beginning. Elite mentality honestly.' Another agreed: 'Bless the guy for not realising he has reached half a century of goals, but at the same time, being a bit annoyed he didn't score more is elite. 'I hope he gets to celebrate that though, cos reaching that at this age as winger isn't easy.' A further fan noted how Saka was seemingly completely completely unaware he had passed the landmark with his two goals in the game: 'I love Saka's reaction to realising he has now scored 50 goals for Arsenal.' Another added: 'God Saka looked so happy and emotional when he was told heâs scored 50 goals for Arsenal. He loves the club. I love him. My heart.'     In netting his 50th goal for the Gunners, Saka became the youngest player since Frank Stapleford to achieve such a milestone for the Gunners. Stapleford spent seven years in North London after joining the club as an apprentice in 1974, making 225 appearances and scoring 75 times during his time at the club.

West Ham fans leave - do real fans stay?,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Is-it-okay-to-leave-your-team-early-West-Ham-fans-leave---do-real-fans-stay/3300917,13 Feb,"AS the Sky Sports cameras panned to the hundreds of West Ham fans flooding out of the London Stadium, their team 4-0 down before the half-time whistle had blown, commentator Rob Hawthorne quipped: 'The train station in Stratford is going to be busy shortly.'  In years gone by, leaving a game early would provoke a tut and a shake of the head from those around you. If enough could be seen flocking to the exits, then chants of 'we can see you sneaking out' would arise from the opposition's fans. Nowadays, the drone of shame is there to capture your departure. There is an unwritten rule in football that states: To be a 'true' fan, you must stay until the end - no matter what. Even if your team is being humiliated, even if it feels as if they are not trying and even if it is painful to watch. That's without taking into account how long your journey home is. There are a lot of things in football that do not make sense and this notion is one of them. When you pay for a football ticket, you do not sign a contract which stipulates you must stay in your seat until the final whistle. The logical argument is that once you have paid your money, for some it will be hundreds of pounds, you can do what you like. If you want to beat the traffic, make sure you get your last train home or are simply fed up with what you are watching - there is no one forcing you to stay. Yet football fans up and down the country have the same internal dialogue, weighing up 'Should I stay or should I go?' Their team is 4-0 down. There is no way back. It makes sense to leave early. But fans wrangle with a sense of guilt. It is not just players they are abandoning.   After a 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace in 2015, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he felt 'pretty alone' after many of his supporters left Anfield in the 82nd minute. 'We decide when it is over,' Klopp said at the time. 'Between 82 and 94 [minutes] you can make eight goals if you like.' Liverpool fans were less inclined to leave in the years that followed. You need only look at their 4-3 victory over Fulham earlier this season to see that Klopp had a point. His side were 3-2 down with three minutes of normal time remaining before two dramatic late goals. Leaving a game early brings an element of risk in that you could miss a memorable comeback - just ask the Newcastle fans who walked out when they trailed Arsenal 4-0 at half-time in 2011, only for their team to score four second half goals. 'I felt worse at full time than I did at half-time,' Newcastle fan Mike Harrison said at the time, after admitting to leaving at the break. 'I'm ashamed of myself. I will never doubt the Toon spirit again.' There is a notion that you are only entitled to enjoy the good times if you endure the bad times. Perhaps it depends on how bad the performance is. In West Ham's case on Sunday, fans would be entitled to feel that there was a lack of effort. That is what hurts supporters most. If players want fans to stay until the end then they need to keep playing until the final whistle. James Jones, co-host of the We Are West Ham podcast, told Mail Sport. 'Fans weren't expecting to beat Arsenal, but we did expect the team to compete. 'A fan's loyalty is displayed the moment they part with their hard earned cash for a ticket, not the time they decide to leave the match. Loyalty is a two way street. Fans pay their money and expect effort, desire and loyalty in return. West Ham fans got nothing in return for their money, other than the embarrassment of losing a London derby in such a humiliating fashion.' Maybe it depends on what time you head for the exit. Is it more acceptable to leave in the 80th minute than the 45th? 'Don't call yourself a true supporter of a club if you're leaving a game at half-time,' Chris Sutton said on our It's All Kicking Off podcast. 'If you're a football supporter, you support your team through thick and thin, don't you? What did Jock Stein say? Football is nothing without fans. Show appreciation to players at the end of the game.' What about how long your journey home is? Is a one-hour commute an acceptable reason to bail out, or does it have to be two? 'I don't blame anyone for leaving earlier,' Harvey Whetstone, who left in the 80th minute, said.  'I don't think people take into account how hard it is to get back to Stratford after a game and there are often problems with trains on Sundays.' But for any supporter planning to leave at half-time in the future, the story of Liverpool fan and playwright Nicky Allt proves the value of sticking out - even if you didn't mean to. With Liverpool 3-0 down in the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul, Allt tried to make his way to the exit. 'I tried to get out of the ground but a big Turkish steward pushed me back in. 'I probably owe him a load of money.'",'I probably owe him a load of money.'
358,"THE NOTEBOOK: Grealish by injury blow, sluggish Doku infuriates Guardiola",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/THE-NOTEBOOK-Grealish-by-injury-blow-sluggish-Doku-infuriates-Guardiola/3301565,2 days ago,"Manchester City survived a scare to beat Copenhagen 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at the Parken Stadium on Tuesday, with Phil Foden scoring late to ensure a two-goal cushion ahead of the second leg.  Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring with a brilliant first-time finish in the 10th minute but the home side roared back with a tremendous equaliser from Magnus Mattsson, who netted in the 34th minute of his debut for the Danish champions. That breathed new life into the raucous Copenhagen crowd, but their team fell behind again just before the break when De Bruyne's persistence in a block tackle saw the ball fall to Bernardo Silva, who finished deftly with his left foot. The Copenhagen defence looked like they had managed to hold firm but Foden cut in from the left in second-half stoppage time to rifle home a third goal and make it 11 wins on the trot for the English champions ahead of the second leg on March 6. Mail Sport's Jack Gaughan takes a look at some of the things you may have missed.  Jack Grealish has been patiently waiting for an opportunity in recent weeks. Heâs been a permanent fixture on the bench for the past month but was given a chance on the big stage last night. He looked to be taking it, always an available option on the left, until injury forced him off in the 21st minute. The England international desperately wanted to continue, much to his managerâs chagrin. Guardiolaâs body language appeared to suggest he was saying that Grealish had nothing to prove by re-entering. He did and was hooked a minute later â once Jeremy Doku had finally warmed himself up. Guardiola went mad at the Belgian wingerâs sluggishness in getting ready to go on.  The Parken atmosphere was a big talking point pre-match and while City didnât fully quieten the ultras behind one goal, they subdued the rest of the stadium. It was down to their early dominance, when Copenhagen couldnât get out of their own half. City imposed themselves from the off. Ruben Dias was the only away player whose average first-half position lay in the City half. Some debut for Magnus Mattsson. He only signed from NEC Nijmegen a fortnight ago and made sure Copenhagen fully capitalised on Edersonâs horrible mistake to equalise. Mattsson was bought to take on goalscoring responsibility but may be the music man in the dressing room, too. Heâs also a producer and has worked with R&B and hip-hop artists. He apparently fancies that as a career once scoring goals in Europe is all over. City chests might be donning the golden Club World Cup badge â and a gold version of the Premier Leagueâs on their sleeves â but it will be some time before they are bestowed the honour of sporting this competitionâs on their kit. Despite being the reigning champions, City need to win the thing five times before UEFA allow them to stitch their badge on permanently. Surely, Guardiola wonât still be around for that. Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne might be back in action now but Manchester City have suffered an injury scare surrounding Mateo Kovacic. Kovacic, who was absent for the weekend victory over Everton, is understood to have sustained a knee problem in training and City were fearing that he was facing weeks out. Pep Guardiola â who is without Josko Gvardiol for the next few weeks â is unsure how Kovacic will react to a return to training later this week and will keep a watchful eye on his progress. Kovacic, 29, has enjoyed a decent first year at the Etihad Stadium and often been utilised alongside Rodri when Guardiola wants to strangle games with possession. The summer signing from Chelsea, who filled the hole left by Ilkay Gundogan, has made 27 appearance so far this term. His absence meant teenager Mahamadou Susoho was called up to the bench alongside fellow academy product Jacob Wright.   Speaking of Gundogan, his wife Sara has said she didnât believe that heâd ever leave City before joining Barcelona on a free transfer. To such an extent that she thought Gundogan was winding her up. âI was in Italy â and I went to meet my friends,â she told Mail Sport. âI just got a phone call saying, âWe are goingâ. I donât know if it was a shock. The funny fact is that I didnât take it seriously. I was like, my husband is many years in Manchester, I donât see this happening.â Given Barcaâs recent form, Gundogan probably wishes heâd stayed put.","Given Barcaâs recent form, Gundogan probably wishes heâd stayed put."

The Catalans landed in Madrid looking to keep themselves in the title race but defeat in Spanish capital was a major blow. Real Madrid have now opened up a five point lead at the top of the table with Girona playing catch up in the campaign run in. However, with some key absences due to suspension, and Michel watching from the stands, they were blown away at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. Successive league losses to Real Madrid are the only league games Girona have slipped up in this and Michel admitted they are on two different levels.  âWeâve not been at the level required to play against Real Madrid and when they are at their maximumâ¦ we are just not thereâ, as per reports from Mundo Deportivo. âWe need to have humility and know where we are. We came to compete and to fight, face to face against a great team. âWe could have stopped them by sitting deep, but thatâs not what I do, Iâm responsible for the defeat.â Girona have no European or Copa del Rey commitments this season and they will continue to battle for the title and a first ever Champions League qualification spot.

360,Arsenal defender Gabriel reveals private chat with Arteta after he dropped him,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-defender-Gabriel-reveals-private-chat-with-Arteta-after-he-dropped-him/3298647,11 Feb,"Arsenal ace Gabriel Magalhaes has opened up on discussions with Mikel Arteta at the start of the season after being dropped.  The Brazilian defender has been a mainstay at the heart of the Arsenal defence since joining from Lille in 2020. But plenty of eyebrows were raised when Gabriel was omitted from the starting line-up for the first three games of the current campaign. At the time, speculation suggested Gabriel's had had been turned by interest from a big-money move to the Saudi Pro League outfits, while others claimed Arteta was merely trying something different with his back-four, as midfielder Thomas Partey was used at right-back, with Ben White moving into Gabriel's role. However, the Brazil international soon returned to the starting line-up and has barely looked back since. Sunday's trip to West Ham will mark Gabriel's 150th appearance for the north Londoners. It's a ground he's had joy at before, but the centre-back will be well aware of the threat the Hammers pose given Arsenal have already been beaten twice by David Moyes' men this term. Ahead of the clash, Gabriel has addressed the early-season drama and speculation surrounding his club future and discussed his conversations with Arteta. ""It was tough, obviously at the start,"" the 26-year-old said. ""I wanted to play and it was very difficult for me but I understood what the coach had to do. ""It is difficult for any player to not be in the team but now Iâm back in I want to keep on working hard to prove my worth. ""He (Arteta) spoke to me and obviously explained the reasons behind the decision. Why I should stay â but the most important thing was to remain focused and concentrate â he knew how important I was to the team, so Iâm happy to be back and to be able to help the team in every game."" Gabriel's central defensive partner William Saliba often earns plenty of the plaudits, but those who watch the Gunners every week will recognise the pair's respective strengths compliment the others weakness and form one of the strongest backline duos in the division. In the Autumn of 2022, Gabriel put pen to paper on a contract extension that ties him to the Emirates until 2027. If he keeps up this rich vein of form, that could prove to be a defining decision from Arteta for all the right reasons.","In the Autumn of 2022, Gabriel put pen to paper on a contract extension that ties him to the Emirates until 2027.

Brazil needed just a draw to secure their passage to the Olympics, but Javier Mascheranoâs under-20 Argentina side fought out a win over the Selecao, with Argentinos Juniors youngster Luciano Gondou heading home the only goal of the game. It leaves Brazil on three points, Argentina on five, Paraguay on four and Venezuela on one with only the latter two to play each other. The top two will qualify.

363,Exclusive: Emmanuel Petit believes Real Sociedad can exploit PSG weakness in Champions League showdown,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Exclusive-Emmanuel-Petit-believes-Real-Sociedad-can-exploit-PSG-weakness-in-Champions-League-showdown/3301793,2 days ago,"The Champions League returns this week with the start of the last 16 ties. Real Madrid picked up victory in the first leg of theirs against RB Leipzig on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, it will be the turn of Real Sociedad, who arguably have the most difficult task of all the La Liga sides left in the competition.  La Real, despite having won their group ahead of the likes of Inter Milan, were drawn against Paris Saint-Germain, who are still trying to achieve their first Champions League success at the umpteenth time of asking. They do have as good a chance as any right now, with Luis Enrique as head coach, and Kylian Mbappe still at the club â albeit maybe not for much longer. PSG will go into the tie as favourites, a title that former Arsenal, Barcelona and France midfielder Emmanuel Petit believes is merited because of La Realâs struggles over the last few weeks. Petit spoke exclusively to Football EspaÃ±a to provide his take on one of the ties of the round in the Champions League. âTwo months has gone since (the group stages ended). Real Sociedad were very impressive then, now itâs completely different. They are struggling, they donât score goals and they have so many top players injured. We all know their quality â they play with a unity, they fight for every ball, they put pressure on their opponents all the time. But they are quite limited in terms of quality and skill, especially in front of goal.â âWith the injuries, they donât have a big squad â Iâm not impressed by the players theyâve had on the bench there recently. For me, they were probably the best team that Paris Saint-Germain could meet, following their performance in the group stages. PSG are like Jekyll and Hyde, but for me â I wonât disrespect Real Sociedad â it would be a huge disappointment for the club (if they didnât progress).â Itâs certainly true that La Real have struggled badly since the Champions League group stages concluded back in December. In eight La Liga matches since their MD6 draw with Inter, they have won just once (1-0 vs Celta Vigo). Worryingly, they have only scored three goals in that period too, although they have progressed to the Copa del Rey semi-finals at least, where they are taking on Mallorca. Despite these struggles, Petit believes that there is a ray of hope for La Real in their quest to reach the last eight, as PSG do typically have difficulties against sides like the one headed up by head coach Imanol Alguacil. âPSG do struggle against teams like this, that play with so much unity and passion on the pitch. Real Sociedad do have a chance, but if PSG play as well as they can, there would be no chance for them.â This is a good point too, and you only have to look to earlier this season in order for it to have taken place. Newcastle United werenât anywhere near one of the best teams in the Champions League, yet they took four points off PSG in the group stages, including inflicting a 4-1 defeat at St Jamesâ Park in what was a big shock. This is largely the reason why the French champions will be facing La Real at this stage. Wednesdayâs first leg at the Parc de Princes will be crucial towards dictating how the tie plays out. If Real Sociedad can keep things tight in Paris, they will fancy their chances of progression, especially with the return leg at the Reale Arena with the passionate supporters all behind them. PSG could struggle in this environment, as has been shown before. This interview was conducted with Betway.",This interview was conducted with Betway.

Their 4-0 victory over Girona on Saturday now has them five points clear at the top of La Liga, and that result was all the more impressive considering they played with no recognised central defenders.  With Nacho Fernandez and Antonio Rudiger both missing (Eder Militao and David Alaba, although they are long-term absentees), Dani Carvajal and Aurelien Tchouameni operates as centre-backs, and to great effect too. However, head coach Carlo Ancelotti will be keen to playing players in their natural positions going forward. That should be the case on Tuesday when Real Madrid travel to face RB Leipzig in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. MD report that Nacho returned to training on Sunday, and he should be fit to face the Bundesliga side. Itâs a welcome boost for Real Madrid to have Nacho back, especially considering Jude Bellingham is to miss the next three weeks after suffering an ankle injury against Girona. That comes at a bad time for Los Blancos, who are aiming for their 15th European crown.","Itâs a welcome boost for Real Madrid to have Nacho back, especially considering Jude Bellingham is to miss the next three weeks after suffering an ankle injury against Girona.

The art of seeing the goal, picturing the flight of the ball and being so desperate not to use your weak foot to the point where youâll wrap one leg around the other and risk making a complete fool of yourself is an art not for the faint-hearted. So when it comes off, goodness gracious is it a jaw-dropper. In tribute to the pinnacle of p*ss-taking, weâve gathered together a collection of the naughtiest rabonas youâll ever witness. Obscene. Timed his run to perfection. Played it right by the textbook. Peeled off his man and loitered to the penalty spot where everyone was expecting a diplomatic finish, nestled into the bottom corner. Until the intrusive thoughts kicked in and Santos sent the ball curling into top bins with the naughtiest trick in the book â the page ripped out at the back because itâs simply too disgusting. Nasty. Youâre thinking of the one against Arsenal, arenât you? A brilliant finish, but it wasnât even his best rabona, which is frankly absurd. Lamela made the Europa League his playground in 2014 with one from outside the box. Combining the art of goal poaching in the box with the dark arts of the rabona? Sounds too good to be true, but it isnât. Enter 16-year-old Martins for Benfica. Sixteen. A rabona finish in a way only Balotelli could possibly score one; an obscene and hilariously unnecessary amount of step-overs before eventually smashing it past the goalkeeper. Remains one of the funniest finishes of all time. What do you do when youâre in the box and painfully close to goal, but youâve been forced down a corridor and shown a rather improbable angle? Just shift it out of your feet and dink the goalkeeper with a rabona, obviously. Perotti deserved two goals for this. Right, technically this didnât happen in a game, but you canât do a rabona article and not include Quaresma. The man made a career out of being allergic to using his left foot, by simply becoming so good at trivellas and rabonas that it no longer mattered. Exhibit A: Everything about this clip is stunning. The baggy shirt. A young, scrawny Di Maria scrambling past the last man. The way heâs going wide but then pulls it together with the most ridiculous finish he can muster up, before wheeling away in celebration. Keeper had no chance. No manâs land. He gets a tad fortunate with the rebound off the defender coming back to him, but immediately makes up for it with the most insane, instinctive thinking ever. Dinking a keeper is one thing, but dinking a keeper with a rabona, inside La Bombonera? Jonathan Calleri, take a bow. No thoughts, no touch, just pure carnage. Chilean league circa 2011, we salute you. Urbano had all the time in the world to take down the cross and get a proper shot off, but instead meets it first time in what is a truly spectacular show of technique. Couldâve very easily made a fool of himself, but instead bagged an all-time worldie.","Urbano had all the time in the world to take down the cross and get a proper shot off, but instead meets it first time in what is a truly spectacular show of technique.

However there have been a large number of names linked to the position, and Gerard Romero claims that Barcelona have narrowed their shortlist to just three candidates, one of which is Italian, one of which is German, and one of which is Spanish. A number of the names linked fit that criteria, although the Italian option would most clearly appear to be Brighton coach Roberto de Zerbi. He has a â¬12m release clause in his contract and is thought to be in high demand this summer. Several German coaches have been linked to the role, most cloesly with former Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick. Julian Nagelsmann and current Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel have also beens uggested as options. The former does not have a contract with Germany beyond the summer, and there is a feeling that Tuchel could leave Bayern at the end of the year. Finally, the Spanish manager is perhaps the hardest work out. Garcia Pimienta, Michel Sanchez and Imanol Alguacil have all distanced themselves from the job, and speculation surrounding them has died down.

Reds boss Jurgen Klopp has been a long-time critic of the slot and here, the PA news agency looks at Liverpoolâs record in early kick-offs under Klopp. Graphic showing Premier League teams with the most Saturday lunchtime kick-offs since Jurgen Klopp  The clash at the Gtech Community Stadium will be Liverpoolâs 44th Saturday lunchtime kick-off since the German arrived on Merseyside in October 2015, which is the most of any Premier League club in that time. Manchester City and Tottenham have each played 39, ahead of Manchester United (34) and Chelsea (33). Klopp has overseen a total of 21 wins, 14 draws and eight defeats in the early Saturday slot, which equates to 1.79 points per game. That represents the second-best record among âbig sixâ clubs, behind City (2.26), but is well below his average return across all other kick-off times (2.17). Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, left, and Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola  Liverpoolâs performances in Saturday lunchtime games have been indicative of their title prospects in recent years, with the Reds having won all 12 of such matches in 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2021-22 â seasons in which they won the title or finished within a point of Pep Guardiolaâs City. By contrast, Kloppâs team won just one of five 12:30 kick-offs in 2020-21 â when they barely made it into the top four â and none of six on the way to finishing fifth last season. It is their fifth early Saturday kick-off this season â also the most in the Premier League, breaking a tie with Spurs and Everton â with an encouraging return of three wins so far alongside a draw with City. Ivan Toney scores Brentfordâs second goal in last season  Among all Premier League clubs, Liverpool rank fifth by points per game in early kick-offs since Kloppâs arrival. Only City of the teams ahead of them have played even five games but of note is the fact Brentford have won all four of their 12:30 kick-offs since their promotion to the Premier League in 2021, with some notable scalps along the way. Thomas Frankâs side won 2-0 at Wolves in their first such game in September 2021, 2-1 in a rare lunchtime setback for City and 3-1 at Tottenham last season, and 2-0 at Chelsea earlier this term. This will be their first Premier League home game in that time slot. They are without the injured Bryan Mbeumo, who has scored in three of those wins including a brace against Spurs, but the recently returned Ivan Toney scored the penalty opener against Wolves and both goals â including a dramatic stoppage-time winner â against City. Nottingham Forest and Cardiff each average two points per early kick-off, in just three and two games respectively.","Nottingham Forest and Cardiff each average two points per early kick-off, in just three and two games respectively."

373,Phil Foden says he is âplaying my best footballâ after eight goals in 10 games,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Phil-Foden-says-he-is-%E2%80%98playing-my-best-football%E2%80%99-after-eight-goals-in-10-games/3302036,1 day ago,"Phil Foden feels he is in the form of his life as he eyes a second successive treble with Manchester City. The England midfielder stepped up in the injury-enforced absence of Kevin De Bruyne to thrive in a central role in numerous games in the first half of the season. De Bruyneâs return to action over the past month has seen Fodenâs position vary since but his performance levels have rarely dipped. Playing alongside De Bruyne, the 23-year-old again excelled in Tuesdayâs Champions League victory at FC Copenhagen, capping a fine display with an eighth goal in 10 outings. âI think itâs the most run of games that Iâve played in a City shirt consistently,â said Foden. âIâm in good form, scoring consistently and helping the team as much as I can and Iâm delighted with that. âI want to keep doing that, thatâs the goal every game. Iâd say Iâm playing my best football in a City shirt.â Foden has been touted for big things since he was in Cityâs junior ranks but it is now over six years since he made his senior debut. When prolific striker Erling Haaland joined De Bruyne on the sidelines in December, Foden felt it was time he took responsibility. âI think I had to,â said Foden, who scored a hat-trick in last weekâs Premier League win at Brentford. âThey are two massive players for us, so key last year for us winning the treble. It was time for me to step up.â Cityâs 3-1 win in Copenhagen in the first leg of their last-16 tie was their 11th in succession in all competitions. They are strongly fancied to defend all three of the major trophies they won last season and Foden has no doubt the team have the hunger to do so. He said: âWeâre showing that weâre still determined and playing the same football as last year and still wanting to win all the games. Hopefully that continues and we donât drop our level or form. âWeâre focused. We stick by each other and itâs a pleasure to be a part of this team. I look around the dressing room and I still see the determination and hunger.â Phil Foden  Foden has made no secret of his preference to play in a central position, something which became a matter of national debate earlier this season when England manager Gareth Southgate selected him in a wide role. Foden said: âIâve said previously that I prefer to play in the middle but Iâll do a job wherever the manager puts me. Tuesday I was out wide, and I got a goal and an assist. Iâm delighted.â","Foden said: âIâve said previously that I prefer to play in the middle but Iâll do a job wherever the manager puts me.

Already he is attracting interest from elsewhere though, according to the latest in Catalonia.  With a yearly salary of nearly â¬25m, Barcelona either want to bring down his wages to around â¬15m with a new contract, or sell him this summer, as per Sport. They also carry a report from Jijantes that claims that Tottenham Hotspur have made a â¬60m offer for de Jong. Spurs are willing to offer him a four-year deal with a pay packet that would come close to what he currently earns in Barcelona if he hits targets. Earlier it was reported that Barcelona are looking for â¬100m for de Jong, which would see them some way apart on their valuation.","Earlier it was reported that Barcelona are looking for â¬100m for de Jong, which would see them some way apart on their valuation."

The high praise for the Portuguese full-back came from Paul Merson, who was watching from the Sky Sports studio at Villa Park. In the 86th minute Kobbie Mainoo fought off the attention of two Villa players in the right-hand corner to flick it out towards Dalot. The ball was set invitingly for Dalot and he whipped in a stunning cross first-time with speed, right onto the head of McTominay to nod in to seal a 2-1 win in what is a major boost to United's top four hopes. 'That's a David Beckham cross,' Merson said. 'That's a David Beckham cross... you've just got to get on the end of it.'  In his heyday, Beckham was considered one of the finest wingers of his generation and during his time at United much of the attacking focus came from balls whipped in from out wide. And so comparisons to Beckham, who went on to play for the likes of Real Madrid, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, is not to be dismissed lightly. Dalot has come in for plenty of criticism this season but this was a positive display following a positive few weeks. For Erik ten Hag, he has never doubted his right back's qualities. 'Everyone gets criticism but he is a fantastic player who is developing very well,' the Dutchman told Match of the Day 2.  'He can play in so many positions and he is improving on crosses. He can score and his defending is improving so I am very pleased with him.' More to follow.",More to follow.

The Parisians will resume their quest for an elusive Champions League title in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the Parc des Princes and Enrique refused to say his side were favourites. Enrique told a press conference: âReal Sociedad have a tight defence in the Champions League. They donât give the ball away easily. We will have to press them aggressively. âThey are certainly one of the best teams in the competition. That is why they qualified as group winners.

They are top level and Iâm not going to get into whether we are favourites or not. âMy team has to show that on the pitch. That is where we do the talking.â Sociedad were unbeaten as they finished top of Group D ahead of Inter Milan, beaten 1-0 by Manchester City in last seasonâs final in Istanbul. The Spanish side won three and drew three of their six group matches â they beat Benfica home and away â and Enrique saluted head coach Imanol Alguacil and his club. âI hope it is not a decisive factor that he has been there six years and I have been here six months,â Enrique added. âI know the coach very well. He is a great coach. Luis Enrique is a big admirer of Real Sociedad head coach Imanol Alguacil, pictured  âHe is at home with a fantastic philosophy. They bring through many players themselves. They are well balanced. They do well in the transfer market. âThey have been playing really good football during his six years there, and even before that, as there were other coaches who did a great job there. âSo he is reaping the fruits of the hard work by the club. I can only congratulate them. I hope they donât play as well tomorrow and in the second leg.â Kylian Mbappe (ankle) is expected to start after being rested last Saturday when PSG moved 11 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 after their 3-1 home win against Lille.

377,Man Utd 'make Newcastle's Ashworth their top target to become sporting director',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-Utd-make-Newcastles-Ashworth-their-top-target-to-become-sporting-director/3301591,2 days ago,"Manchester United have reportedly made Dan Ashworth their top target for their new sporting director - the major hitch being that he currently holds that role at Newcastle.  The Athletic reports that Ashworth is open to joining United and talks are expected to unfold rapidly, although no formal approach has been made. Ashworth, who used to work for Brighton, is highly rated for his recruitment skills but his contract at Newcastle will make negotiations complicated. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are trying to implement radical change behind the scenes at Old Trafford, having already poached Omar Berrada from Manchester City to be their CEO. Any revamp would benefit considerably from Ashworth, who brings 24 years of experience from Peterborough, Cambridge, West Brom, the FA, Brighton, and Newcastle.  He was technical director at Brighton from spring 2019, helping to oversee a revolution in the club's playing style and recruitment with Graham Potter as manager. Ashworth joined Newcastle after leaving Brighton in June 2022. His departure from the AMEX Stadium saw him put on gardening leave for an extended period of time while Newcastle negotiated his initial move to St James' Park. His role at United would see him have a hands-on relationship with player recruitment, as per The Athletic. Last month, Mail Sport reported that Newcastle were confident they could keep Ashworth, with chief executive Darren Eales emphasising how 'happy' he is with the Toon. Ratcliffe, who completed his Â£1.3billion buy-out of a 25 per cent stake in the club in December, wants to transform football operations. That includes using a data-led approach, chasing younger players in the market, and taking a scythe to Erik ten Hag's influence over transfers. Director of data science Dominic Jordan, who inaugurated the role in 2022, said he expects his field to be 'transformational' for the side. United's current boardroom doesn't boast a sporting director, a decision that has been heavily criticised during a period when the club's recent recruitment has been scrutinised.    Mail Sport has previously reported that current football director John Murtough will leave the club amid an overhaul to their structure. The Premier League still has to ratify Ratcliffe's investment in United, but from there it will be full steam ahead. He has already made a noticeable effort to connect with players and staff, meeting them at Old Trafford and their Carrington training centre. Ratcliffe and INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford were pictured meeting manager Ten Hag as well as men's team striker Rasmus Hojlund and women's team players Millie Turner, Katie Zelem and Aoife Mannion last month. Ratcliffe and Brailsford also met women's team manager Marc Skinner, plus members of the club's academy sides and performance staff during their visit. They also went to Old Trafford for meetings with the wider club workforce and held an all-staff meeting as they get down to business at United.",They also went to Old Trafford for meetings with the wider club workforce and held an all-staff meeting as they get down to business at United.
378,Xabi Alonso is TRUTH: He conquered Bayern & broke Mullerâs brain in this process,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Xabi-Alonso-is-TRUTH-He-conquered-Bayern--broke-Muller%E2%80%99s-brain-in-this-process/3299421,11 Feb,"Xabi Alonso is the truth: He conquered Bayern and broke Thomas Mullerâs brain in the process  This kind of result makes you sit up and take notice. Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 Bayern Munich. If it wasnât clear already, it is now; Xabi Alonso is European footballâs next great coach and it would be an act of lunacy for Liverpool to look anywhere else for Jurgen Kloppâs successor. The win kept up Bayer Leverkusenâs unbeaten run in all competitions. Thirty-one games. Twenty-seven wins. Four draws. Theyâre now five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and still going great guns on all fronts. Not only is Alonso leading Leverkusen â a club that have never won the Bundesliga â to one of the greatest seasons in their history, but heâs masterminding one of the great campaigns from any team, anywhere. It was a flagship performance that will long be looked back on as one of the defining moments for this side. Not since Klopp himself was at Dortmund have Bayern had an opponent of this quality â not only the team, but the architect of their excellence. The comprehensive scoreline was representative of the chasm between the two sides. Leverkusen registered just 38% possession but were perfect with and without the ball. They limited Harry Kane, a striker on track to break Robert Lewandowskiâs Bundesliga record, to his quietest game. They registered eight shots on target to Bayernâs one and kept Thomas Tuchelâs side, the xG leaders of European football, to just 0.27xG. It brought to mind the time Kloppâs Dortmund went and beat Jose Mourinhoâs Real Madrid 4-1 over a decade ago. A statement of a changing of the guard. The future has arrived. Bayernâs wage bill and squad cost dwarfs Leverkusen, but here was a better-coached side bloodying their noses. This was no fluke. Leverkusen are a team built in Alonsoâs image, and he demonstrated that by explaining in great detail how they did it â how they pressed and how they dominated the game by controlling spaces across the pitch. âWe have controlled well the right moment when to press, when to wait, who could have the ball, who could not have the ball,â Alonso told ESPN FC pitchside reporter Archie Rhind-Tutt after the final whistle. âThe discipline they have, not being so dominant with the ball, but to be dominant without the ball. I think that we have done that. Without the ball we have been able to control the spaces, not to receive many chances, to wait for our chance, for sure the first goal was really important. âThe determination, the conviction of the press is what comes to mind first. I need to say thank you to them [the players] to push them, to help them, to keep going.â Leverkusenâs discipline, determination and conviction was rewarded in the final minute of injury time when Jeremie Frimpong put a well-deserved cherry on the icing, capitalising on Manuel Neuer going walkabout by beating his man and shooting into the empty net from range. It was opposite wingback Alejandro Grimaldo that had doubled Leverkusenâs lead early in the second half. The duo have now combined for an outrageous tally of 14 goals and 15 assists in the Bundesliga this season. Which is testament to Alonsoâs tactical acumen; devising a system that gets the very best out of his players. The two wingbacksâ colossal contribution to this team are reminiscent of Antonio Conteâs prime Chelsea, or Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson at their best for Liverpool. So comprehensively were Bayern beaten that club legend Thomas Muller, who only played the last half hour as they hopelessly chased the deficit, didnât hold back on his thoughts. Leverkusenâs masterclass made the 34-year-old look deep within his soul and ask himself what his team-mates were lacking in comparison. âThere are of course some symptoms on the pitch. To be honest, Iâm p**sed off,â the veteran Germany international told Sky Germany after the final whistle. âTo quote Oliver Kahn: What I miss from us players are the balls in the game. We are showing significantly better approaches in training. Itâs okay to feel pressure, but there needs to be energy and freedom. Thatâs missing in our game. âSometimes we have to speak about us players. Itâs not just about the coach. âWe have many international players at the highest level, we need to step up our game.â âSince Xabi Alonso started to make waves as a coach in Germany, people were thinking about the possibility that he would one day go to either Liverpool, Bayern or Real Madrid,â German football expert Rafael Honigstein told TNT Sports earlier this week. âWhat Kloppâs announcement has done is fast-track that discussion, it has opened the door to a job that Iâm sure he will be very tempted to take, especially with the background of Liverpool having stability. Whoever they bring in next might get the kind of longevity and run that Klopp has had. âI think that opportunity, that trainâ¦ it doesnât come along very often and I see Xabi Alonso jumping on it if and when Liverpool decide that he is the right man for it. I donât see how he can turn them down.â The answer for what Liverpool need to go and do this summer is blindingly obvious. Alonso is by a country mile the outstanding candidate for the job. Nailing his latest audition was just the latest proof. But such is his reputation that they might face real competition for his signature from his other former flames. This result heaps the pressure on Thomas Tuchel at Bayern. Real Madrid are flying and Carlo Ancelotti has just recently signed a new contract, but a Champions League exit would suddenly change the picture dramatically at the Bernabeu. Thereâs still lots of the race to run. But Alonso looks to have turned Bayer Neverkusen into bonafide winners. You look at the way his team dismantled Bayern and you question why Europeâs biggest clubs wouldnât be fighting tooth and nail to secure his services. ",

Rice provided two first-half set-piece assists for William Saliba and Gabriel which kickstarted the Gunners on their way, before scoring an impressive goal from outside the box. Arteta said: âIâm really happy with him (Rice). I know that it was an emotional day for him because he loves West Ham so much. âBut he had to focus on the task and what he had to deliver.

When he went to take the corner they clapped him, so it's great to see that kind of reception.   âHe loves this club so much and I know what it meant to him to play today.â The statement victory left Arteta believing that his team now have the momentum to be real contenders for the title coming off the back of beating Liverpool 3-1. âYes we are maintaining and building some momentum now,â he said. âAfter the Liverpool game we had to show that we had that capacity to repeat that level or be better. That was the way we trained the whole week. âPerformances have been strong as well as results in recent weeks. We need to maintain that because other teams are doing that as well.

A top-level player is wanted by Sporting Director Deco, who has listed Evertonâs Amadou Onana as an ideal option for the Catalans.  The problem for Barcelona in regards to Onana is that they are very unlikely to be able to afford him at this stage. Their ongoing financial woes means that they cannot splash out as before, which restricts their ability to sign their ideal targets. There has been talk that Everton would want in the region of â¬60m for Onana, a figure that Barcelona cannot afford. However, as Marca note, the Toffeesâ relegation from the Premier League could well see this asking price drop, which would give the Blaugrana more hope of doing a deal. Everton currently sit in the relegation zone, one point behind Luton Town. Onana would likely push for the exit door if they drop down to the Championship, and Barcelona may need to hope for that if they are to have any chance in securing his signature this summer.","Everton currently sit in the relegation zone, one point behind Luton Town.

The English midfielder suffered the blow in a collision with Pablo Torre, and despite playing on for a few minutes â scoring in the process â he was withdrawn in order not to aggravate the issue.  On Sunday, Real Madrid confirmed that Bellingham had suffered a sprain, which is expected to keep him out of action for 2-3 weeks. It means that he will miss the first leg of Los Blancosâ Champions League last 16 tie with RB Leipzig, as well as La Liga clashes with Rayo Vallecano and Sevilla. Itâs a big blow for Real Madrid and Bellingham, but as Diario AS have revealed, it could have been much worse. They report that the challenge by Torre was one millimetre away from affecting the ligaments in the tibiofibular joint, which would have meant that heâd have missed almost two months of action. In the end, itâs only a strong sprain, which is definitely a silver lining for Real Madrid. They will hope to not miss Bellingham too much during the period in which he is unavailable for action.","In the end, itâs only a strong sprain, which is definitely a silver lining for Real Madrid.

The Bees striker, 27, has missed the majority of the 2023/24 campaign after serving a ban for breaching betting regulations but was still heavily linked with a move in the January transfer window amid interest from Arsenal. Toney, who has plundered three goals in four matches since his return to action, will have just 12 months remaining on his contract in the summer and Frank confirmed earlier this week that he would probably be sold at the end of the season. In an interview with Danish magazine Tipsbladet, it was claimed that Frank had conceded: ""Itâs quite obvious that Ivan Toney will most likely be sold in the summer. It can be expensive to sell your best player but on the other hand, I also know that by the summer, heâll only have a year left on his contract with us."" Of course, the Bees boss wants to keep his talisman. But Toney was asked for his reaction to Frank's comments after scoring in Brentford's 2-0 win over Wolves on Saturday and quipped: ""I see that [Frank's comments] as he doesn't want me! ""The manager has said what he's said but I can't make clubs come and get me. I've just got to keep doing what I do and that's score goals. What will be will be."" Although Arsenal are long-term admirers of Toney, the Gunners were unable to add to their squad in the winter transfer window as a result of their Financial Fair Play commitments. It's expected that Mikel Arteta's side will rekindle their interest in Toney in the summer, but other Premier League clubs - including Chelsea and Tottenham - could hijack any potential move. A deal for the sought after striker is unlikely to be cheap, however, with Frank also stressing that Brentford know exactly what their star man is worth. The Bees boss added: âWe know what heâs worth. I donât think there are many strikers in the world who are better than him right now. Heâs a really good striker who is in his prime footballing age. Personally, as a coach, I would prefer to keep Toney, but one day it could be fun to see him at a top team. This winter, we actually had no bids for him, but it would surprise me if there arenât a lot of clubs interested in him.â","The Bees boss added: âWe know what heâs worth.

383,Alonso set his sights on managing 3 European giants when he joined Leverkusen,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Alonso-set-his-sights-on-managing-3-European-giants-when-he-joined-Leverkusen/3301782,2 days ago,"Spanish football reporter Guillem Balague has revealed the 'secret' career plan Xabi Alonso made for himself when he joined Bayer Leverkusen in October 2022.  Alonso took over Leverkusen when they were in the bottom three, but has transformed the club's fortunes and they are now five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. His impressive work on the touchline has seen him emerge as the favourite to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool when the German coach steps down from his position at the end of the season. But Balague has suggested it is not a foregone conclusion that Alonso will go to Anfield, claiming the Spaniard is also keen on managing two other European giants, and even had a back-up option in place if things went wrong at Leverkusen. 'Iâll tell you a little secret,' Balague said on BBC's The Football News Show.  'When he went to Bayer Leverkusen, he told his agent ""do you know what, I am thinking that if it doesnât go well at Bayer Leverkusen, Iâll go back to Real Sociedad. 'But if it goes well, from here, itâs Liverpool, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich. 'Let me add Manchester City to the equation and thatâs where Xabi Alonso could go next. When, is a different matter.' Alonso played for Liverpool, Madrid and Bayern during his illustrious career, and remains popular with all three sets of supporters. A vacancy is certain to open up at Liverpool this summer, and the Bayern job could also be available as the pressure ramps up on Thomas Tuchel amid a disappointing campaign for the Bavarian club. But taking over at Real Madrid appears less likely given that Carlo Ancelotti extended his contract until 2026 in December. City are also in no rush to replace Pep Guardiola, but he is into the final 18 months of his contract and is yet to commit his long-term future to the club.  Should Alonso decide to remain at Leverkusen for another year, the chance to manage City could become more realistic in 2025. Alonso was quizzed on his future last month, and insisted he is happy at Leverkusen, but refused to rule out moving elsewhere in the coming months. 'At the moment, I am really happy here and enjoying my work here,' he said. 'I feel I am in a great place and I am enjoying it. It is the right place. That is all I can say. What is going to happen in the future? I donât know. And I donât really care at the moment.'",'I feel I am in a great place and I am enjoying it. It is the right place. That is all I can say. What is going to happen in the future? I donât know. And I donât really care at the moment.'
384,Vincent Kompany blames Jurgen Klopp after he's hit with Arsenal touchline ban,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Vincent-Kompany-blames-Jurgen-Klopp-after-hes-hit-with-Arsenal-touchline-ban/3299194,11 Feb,"Burnley boss Vincent Kompany has claimed he only received a yellow card during the 3-1 defeat by Liverpool because Jurgen Klopp had already wound up the referee.  The Clarets were on the end of 17th league defeat of the season after the Reds got the better of them at Anfield, but the clash was not without its talking points from the technical area. Klopp himself was also carded by match official Tim Robinson after the Liverpool boss let his emotions get the better of him. Diogo Jota fired Liverpool in front, but just before the interval Dara O'Shea's header silenced the home crowd and drew the visitors level. That was until goals from both Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez ensured all three points remained in the red half of Merseyside and sent Liverpool to the top of the table. After the game, Kompany made clear he felt that Robinson was keen on handing him a yellow card to even things up between the two managers. It marked the Belgian's third caution of the season, which in turn means the Burnley boss will be banned from the touchline when they host Arsenal next weekend. ""I'd say it's a little bit to do with the game,"" Kompany claimed ""I think I got booked because I should have paid attention to the fact that Jurgen Klopp got booked because then all I think the referee did was just went looking for me. ""I opened my arms out, which I have done exactly that in many games. Then all of a sudden the card comes out. Out of nothing. Now I am suspended for the next game. I should have known it was just a way to balance it out and it doesn't make sense, but hey, we have to keep going. No sulking."", He wasn't the only one to address the yellow cards after the game, with Klopp also making clear he felt Kompany was unlucky to be cautioned while reflecting on his own punishment. The Liverpool boss also used his post-match media duties as a chance to ridicule the idea of a 'blue card' for sin-bins, a proposal recently raised by the game's lawmakers International Football Association Board. ""It was emotional, definitely,"" Klopp explained. ""Imagine in this game and the referee has a blue card available? It would have been the wild west. There were so many yellow cards today. ""I had no clue why Vincent Kompany got it. I lost it in that situation so fine, give me a yellow card. As long as I don't get a blue one and have to sit somewhere for 10 minutes!""","""I had no clue why Vincent Kompany got it. I lost it in that situation so fine, give me a yellow card.

385,Ferdinand names Man City star as the most important player in the Premier League,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ferdinand-names-Man-City-star-as-the-most-important-player-in-the-Premier-League/3301600,2 days ago,"Rio Ferdinand had labelled one Man City star as 'the most important player in the Premier League' following his excellent performance during City's 3-1 victory against FC Copenhagen on Tuesday night.  City produced a controlled and professional display to brush past the Danish side and give themselves a 2-0 cushion for the return leg of their Champions League tie on March 6. Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring after ten minutes with a precise strike across the face of the goal, before Magnus Mattsson pulled one back for the home side. Bernardo Silva restored the lead for City before half-time with Phil Foden wrapping up the win in injury time to silence the racous home crowd. City have now claimed their 11th consecutive victory across all competitions and show no signs of slowing down as they sit two points behind Liverpool in the Premier League standings. Yet, Ferdinand highlighted one player for his brilliant performance during the match, and throughout the last few seasons, lumping praise on Rodri as the league's most pivotal player.  'I just think thereâs complete control in their team,' he told TNT Sports after the game. 'Thereâs expeience thereâs control and they know theyâve got players who can end the game when need be. Even when they were pegged back to 1-1 the atmosphere lifted off the roof immediately but that didnât have any impact on the pitch. 'Rodri I have to say, I have to single out we all marvel over stats these days and we talk about players like Foden and De Bruyne. 'But the rhythm of this game is control and that drives through one person and that is Rodri, he is phenomenal and he is the conductor within this team.' He added: 'Itâs actually over a year since theyâve lost when heâs played in the team. Thatâs how important he is. I think heâs possibly the most important player for any team in the Premier League.' Rodri has remarkably not seen his side loose when he's been included in the team sheet since February 5, 2023.   The defensive midfielder has also found the back of the net six times in 30 appearances across all competitions. He is crucial for City at both ends of the pitch, utilising his excellent knowledge of the game to fill holes in defence while also scoring important goals at the other end of the field, with his winning strike in last year's Champions League final being a testament to that. Joleon Lescott, speaking to TNT Sports added: 'His importance when theyâre out of possession, his ability to read the play nullify attacks especially when theyâre high up the field. 'He wins the ball back and forces play to be so precise so high up the pitch and like Rio says heâs so important to the team.'",'He wins the ball back and forces play to be so precise so high up the pitch and like Rio says heâs so important to the team.'

Thomas Tuchel's side were keen for an immediate bounce back after defeat to Bayer Leverkusen left them five points adrift of the top spot in the Bundesliga on Saturday night. But the visitors struggled to break past the hosts at the Stadio Olimpico, and were unable to reduce the deficit after Dayot Upamecano's foul on Gustav Isaksen handed Lazio a penalty - and the defender a red card - which was coolly struck by Ciro Immobile. The Bundesliga champions will hope for a stronger showing next month at the Allianz Arena in a bid to progress to the quarter-finals with silverware on the line. But the TNT Sports pundits were pessimistic about Bayern's chances of comeback, should they play as they did in Rome.   'Bayern are playing ugly football. It is ugly,' Ferdinand said after the final whistle. 'I wouldn't bet against Lazio going there and stifling them again. 'Bayern have a lack of confidence, they are in a rut and I don't see how they are going to get out of it before the second leg. 'If they don't have good results in the league before then I don't know how they turn it around. Too many big names are out of shape, out of form, out of confidence and things are just not quite clicking for Bayern.' Before hosting the Serie A side in Bavaria, Tuchel's team have three Bundesliga ties to play against VfL Bochum, RB Leipzig, and Freiburg, and the former Manchester United cited the break between ties as a sole positive. The best news for them, apart from the fact that the tie stands only at 1-0, is that the return game is in three weeks,' he continued. 'This will give them some time to recover their form. 'If this game was any time soon, this team does not look like they have it in them to play anywhere near their strengths to get a result.' He also compared the Bavarian giants to being like a 'soap opera', adding: 'sometimes when things aren't going your way every little mistake becomes a big highlighted factor and it amounts to a penalty, a goal or a big situation at the football club. 'When it is such big club like Bayern Munich where every little factor is highlighted it becomes a soap opera every weekend and that is where they are at the moment.' Hargreaves was similarly damning, stating that the criticism Bayern Munich will no doubt receive is likely to be deserved. 'Everyone is going to get hammered in the media, players and coaches, and rightly so,' Hargreaves added. 'Bayern Munich were favourites, Thomas Tuchel is a world-class coach, the players are world class and rightly so. 'When you play for the big teams, when you play like that, you are going to get criticised. Frustration will be huge in and around Bayern right now.'  Tuchel himself cut a frustrated figure in his post-match interviews, pointing at that his team were 'completely responsible' for their inability to overturn Maurizio Sarri's players. 'We started well, had a chance in the first minute and then with Harry Kane and then with Jamal Musiala,' The former Chelsea and PSG head coach said. 'We had the game under control in the first half. 'But in the second our performance dropped inexplicably. We made too many individual errors and made our opponents stronger and we lost concentration. We lost our rhythm. 'It was completely our responsibility. We lost a game today that in the first half looked like we could not lose it.'",'It was completely our responsibility. We lost a game today that in the first half looked like we could not lose it.'

Riffing on the infamous half-and-half tourist scarves, these commemorative items are one quarter traditional United red and black, to welcome Ratcliffe and his INEOS team to Old Trafford, and three quarters green and gold â to represent the ongoing protest against the Glazers. The scarves - designed by Paddy Power - will be given away outside Old Trafford ahead of United's first home game in the new era, against Fulham on Saturday February 24. There will be 1,000 limited edition scarves given away outside the United ground and a further 100 scarves given away on Twitter (X) later today - ensuring those who can't make the journey to the game are included in the fun. United will be looking to extend their winning run against Luton Town on Sunday afternoon, having registered wins against Aston Villa, West Ham and Wolves in their recent games.   The Red Devils will then take on Fulham - who are sitting 12th in the table, six placed behind them - on February 24, the day Paddy Power will be handing out the limited edition scarves. Speaking about the scarves, a spokesman Paddy Power said: 'The way Manchester United fans are going, Sir Jim Ratcliffe could be their biggest ever signing. 'It's just a shame that he's a 71-year-old Chelsea season ticket holder, and not a decent centre back. 'Half-and-half scarves always struck me as meaningless, but this quarter-and-three-quarter scarf celebrates a potentially iconic moment in United's history. 'Iconic in that either it will mark the fallen giant's resurgenceâ¦ or will just kick-start an entire new era of banter. I know what I'm hoping for.' Man United fans have been seen attending games in non-traditional colours to make a statement. They've been pictured wearing yellow and green scarfs to protest against the Glazer family ownership. The have swapped their red scarves for yellow and green to pay homage to the club's former days, having originally been founded under the name Newton Heath Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Football Club in 1878. Newton Heath played in a yellow and green throughout their 24-year existence before the club eventually changed it's name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to Old Trafford eight years later. Manchester United's current fanbase have decided to revert back to the gold and green because they feel Newton Heath had better values, with the club being populated by railway workers full of passion for the game. The decision to rep the Newton Heath colour came around as the United fans looked to make a statement against the Glazer family - who they believe has been killing the club.   Ratcliffe's 25 per cent stake in Manchester United is set to be officially confirmed next week as INEOS have received Premier League approval and are now awaiting the final nod from the Football Association before the formalities of the deal are completed. A statement from the league read: 'Sir Jim Ratcliffe's acquisition of 25 per cent of Manchester United and further investment of $300 million in the club, has been approved by the Premier League board following the completion of the Owners' and Directors' Test. 'The board agreed to the change of the club's ownership structure last week, and this has now been officially ratified by an Independent Oversight Panel. 'The Premier League's Owners' Charter has also been signed. 'This is the first acquisition of Control to be reviewed and approved by a new Independent Oversight Panel following changes to the process which were agreed by Premier League clubs in March 2023. The Premier League now awaits confirmation of the transaction's completion.' ",

The home side survived early pressure from Athletic, but Luis Maximiano was not forced into uncomfortable situations. Almeria would also have a late header that was not taken advantage of, having looked promising on the break with Largie Ramazani. Less than 10 minutes into the second half, he would be creating a headache for Gaizka Garitano, as he received his second yellow, leaving his side with 10 men. That invited Los Leones forward, who brought on Iker Muniain, Oihan Sancet and Raul Garcia to try and find the breakthrough. The latter was making his 600th La Liga appearance, and is now closing in on the record of 621 set by Joaquin Sanchez and Andoni Zubizarreta, although it is already out of reach this season. He nearly had the crucial goal though, flighting an excellent header off the inside of the post inside the final 10 minutes. That was as close as they came though, and it was Almeria who had the big chance late on to win it. In Matchday 24, after 7 draws and 16 defeats, down to 10-men and holding a Champions League-spot contender, it fell to Serbian teenager Marko Milovanovic to win their first match of the season. One-on-one with Unai Simon, his effort agonisingly clipped the bar on its way out. The way goes on for Almeria, who continue to appeal to gods and averages alike. Despite their late escape, Athletic will be disappointed with both the performance and the result. They could have gone level with Atletico Madrid in fourth, but remain two points back in fifth, albeit eight clear of Real Betis.","The way goes on for Almeria, who continue to appeal to gods and averages alike.

390,Aguero says he didn't want to leave City & was shocked when Messi exited Barca,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Aguero-says-he-didnt-want-to-leave-City--was-shocked-when-Messi-exited-Barca/3301273,13 Feb,"Sergio Aguero has reflected on his short stay at Barcelona and having to retire from the game due to a heart problem.  Aguero was a hugely prolific striker during his heyday and is best-known for a decorated 10-year spell with Man City. The Argentine - who scored 41 times in 101 caps for his country - remains City's all-time leading goalscorer with 260 goals. But after slipping down the pecking order under Pep Guardiola, the club revealed in March 2021 that he would leave that summer upon the expiry of his contract. And Aguero revealed he was keen to stay at the club he had grown to love, but soon saw his head-turned by the opportunity of joining Barcelona.   'In January 2021 City told me that they were not going to renew my contract,' he told Juan Pablo Varsky on Clank. 'In February they confirmed it to me. 'I wanted one more year, I was willing to be on the bench. I had been playing little with Pep, but I wanted to help. 'I felt that being a year it was going to serve me physically to play in the World Cup. '(But then) a call came from Barca, but they couldn't pay me what City were. I didn't care, I told my manager to put the numbers in and it was fixed in two days. 'When I had it closed I spoke to Leo (Messi), I imagined playing with him and what happened happened....' However, a reunion with his fellow countryman never took place, with Barcelona unable to afford a new deal for Messi, who eventually joined PSG, due to financial restrictions. And Aguero admitted that was tough to take and he couldn't quite believe Messi would depart the club where he became an icon. He added: 'Leo assured me that it was going to be fixed (his renewal with Barca), that he was going to start training. 'I saw the news and I thought it was a fake. I wrote to him and he said ""yes"". I didn't even know what answer him, I didn't answer him anymore. I saw him the next day and he was pretty bad. 'As soon as Leo left, the club offered me the number 10, I told them no. No. because I didn't want to use it, I had been the 10 in all my clubs... but I believed that Messi was going to return. 'I told them that someone else should use it. ""You are the only one who can use it, you or Ansu"", they told me. I told them to give it to Ansu Fati, for me the 10 is Leo's, if he's not there, don't use it.' After a slow bedding in period at the Nou Camp, Aguero made his debut in October 2021 against Valencia. However, in just his fifth appearance, he was taken to hospital with chest discomfort during a 1-1 draw with Alaves. Initially, it was reported that Aguero would miss three months of action, but after being diagnosed as cardiac arrhythmia - which is a condition of irregularities in the heartbeat - Aguero retired in December 2021 on the advice of doctors. And the 35-year-old opened up on being forced to stop playing the game he loved and that fateful day against Alaves.   'As we reach the end of a play I jump to head and start looking at my goal,' he said. 'I'm starting to get dizzy, I wanted to say something and the words weren't coming out. 'The Alaves defender was there and grabbed my hand. He started shouting until the referee saw me and stopped the collision. 'When I got down on the grass is when that pressure went down. And my heart started beating faster. I got the arrhythmia. I had already had smaller episodes. 'And a week before it had happened to me in training. The doctor told me to calm down that it was going to stop, but it didn't stop. 'Two minutes were like 20. I took it as if it was going to cure, and I was hospitalised for four days and then the diagnosis came.'","'Two minutes were like 20.

391,Rio Ferdinand claims that Bukayo Saka is NOT 'world-class',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Rio-Ferdinand-claims-that-Bukayo-Saka-is-NOT-world-class/3301199,13 Feb,"Rio Ferdinand has insisted that Arsenal star Bukayo Saka is not a 'world-class' talent, despite his scintillating performances for the north London side.  Saka, 22, starred in Arsenal's recent 6-0 victory over West Ham on Sunday afternoon, where he picked up a brace after finding the back of the net either side of the break. In doing so, Saka became the youngest player in more than 40 years to reach 50 goals for Arsenal and also took his total goal contributions to 100 exactly. However, despite the 22-year-old's impressive performances, former Manchester United centre-back Ferdinand is not convinced the player is 'world-class'. Speaking on Vibe with FIVE, Ferdinand said: 'Not yet. Listen, I think Saka's been unreal. I actually think he needs a bit of a rest, so many games for a young kid.  'But I think, it's almost like what is world-class? He hasn't done it in the Champions League, has he? I'm talking in the nitty-gritty stages,' he said. 'Saka's top, don't get me wrong. He's not world-class yet.' On Sunday afternoon, Saka reached the 50-goal milestone from the penalty spot on 41 minutes before Gabriel and Leandro Trossard made it 4-0 at the interval. The 22-year-old added a second goal after the restart with Declan rice joining the rout against his former club by capping off the victory with a stunning goal at the London Stadium. Despite such an emphatic victory, Saka reflected after the game that Arsenal could have had more if they had been more clinical. 'We were four nil up in the first half and could have scored many more, including myself. I think today we smelled blood, we went for the kill. 'We did really well to score more. I'm really happy to achieve that (50 Arsenal goals). But I'm not sure I can be happy today.  'I missed some chances I thought I could have scored. It's a great achievement. I'm proud of that.' Elsewhere in the match, the Gunners also found the back of the net thanks to William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice. Former Hammer Rice easily had the pick of the bunch after smashing a long-range effort into the top corner. Despite the tremendous strike, Rice managed to performed a restrained celebration against his former side.","Despite the tremendous strike, Rice managed to performed a restrained celebration against his former side."

What has become apparent this season since MbappÃ© shifted conclusively from his preferred position on the left into the central striking role, is that PSG are no longer targeting a left winger as his replacement. According to Sports Zone, this is because the club have been impressed with Bradley Barcolaâs (21) progress on the left wing. The summer signing from Olympique Lyonnais has helped develop a well-balanced attacking trio alongside Ousmane DembÃ©lÃ© (26) and MbappÃ©, that the club will look to build on, rather than break up further with the replacement of MbappÃ©. This means that PSG will instead look at strikers and have begun to narrow down their search to three options: Napoliâs Victor Osimhen (25), Internazionale Milanâs Lautaro MartÃ­nez (26), and RB Leipzigâs Benjamin Å eÅ¡ko (20). Osimhen in particular could prove to be an interesting choice but the club will face a steep battle to secure the Nigerian international. PSG had two bids worth over â¬100 million each rejected by Napoli last summer, and interest in the player has only increased since then. Itâs no secret that Premier League sides have been circling the star since he led Napoli to their third-ever scudetto last season. Chelsea in particular are thought to be admirers of the former Lille forward and a summer bid is expected from the London club. GFFN | Nick Hartland",GFFN | Nick Hartland
393,Ten Hag claims Douglas Luiz's shimmy celebration might have FUELLED Utd's winner,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ten-Hag-claims-Douglas-Luizs-shimmy-celebration-might-have-FUELLED-Utds-winner/3300569,12 Feb,"Erik ten Hag admitted that Douglas Luizâs shimmy celebration may have spurred his Manchester United players to beat Aston Villa and close the gap in the race for the top-four.  The Brazilian launched into his routine in front of the Holte End when he cancelled out Rasmus Hojlundâs opener in the second half. But it also appeared to be straight at Raphael Varane who held out his arms in protest. When Scott McTominay headed Unitedâs winner in the 86th minute, Varane made a beeline for Luiz and the confrontation between the two players only ended when referee Rob Jones intervened. Former United favourite Rio Ferdinand poked fun at the Villa man on social media afterwards, posting a photo of Luiz doing his shimmy with the caption: âU ok?â Ten Hag tried to be more diplomatic but admitted that that celebration may have âfuelisedâ (fuelled) his players.  âI donât have an opinion about that,â said the United boss. âI havenât spoken to the players. Maybe it's fuelising, I don't know. âI donât think it is important. It is about us, we have to think about our game and not the opposition.â Ten Hag was frustrated that United didnât do more to close the game out after going ahead through Rasmus Hojlund in the first half. âThe way we did it, I liked it. I especially liked the first 20 minutes when we controlled the game. But once we scored we changed our mind-set. For me, you must play on. âIt was too much like a tennis match, we had problems in the counter-attack. It was so open and it could go two ways but we found the mentality and character to win the game.â","âIt was too much like a tennis match, we had problems in the counter-attack.

Mourinho was sacked on January 17 following a 3-1 defeat at AC Milan that left Roma ninth in the table, just two days after comparing himself to Harry Potter for raising expectations at the club. Roma's owners, American businessmen Dan and Ryan Friedkin, appeared to disagree as they fired Mourinho, but the Portuguese manager has now hit back by claiming his dismissal was 'unfair'. Writing as an ambassador for Football.com earlier this week, Mourinho said: 'European competitions are about to start, particularly the Champions League, perhaps the most important competition in the world calendar. I won't be there for these final stages, not because I've been eliminated before, but because I've been ""eliminated"" by someone who has little knowledge of football. 'That's life, full of ups and downs, and I'm on the up, despite the dismissal that was as unexpected as it was unfair. But I'll be back, and even more eagerly and confidently, for these UEFA matches.'  Mourinho left Roma after two-and-a-half years at the club, having led them to Europa Conference League glory in 2022, before taking them to the Europa League final the following year. But things unravelled quickly in his final season, causing Roma to act as they replaced him with former player Daniele De Rossi. De Rossi has won three of his first four games at the helm to guide Roma up to sixth, while Mourinho is still waiting for his next opportunity in the dugout. He has been linked with a possible move to Saudi Arabia, but Mourinho's vow to return to UEFA's elite competitions indicates that he feels he has unfinished business in Europe. Mail Sport revealed last month that Mourinho is keen to return to Manchester United, while he would also love the opportunity to manage Chelsea again. Moving back to the Premier League is far from guaranteed, though, and he has been reportedly been learning German to prepare himself for the possibility of succeeding Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich. Tuchel has come under increasing pressure over the past week after his side lost to Bayer Leverkusen and Lazio, and he is hanging onto his job by a thread ahead of this weekend's Bundesliga clash with VfL Bochum.","Tuchel has come under increasing pressure over the past week after his side lost to Bayer Leverkusen and Lazio, and he is hanging onto his job by a thread ahead of this weekend's Bundesliga clash with VfL Bochum."
395,Barca President Laporta will only consider removing Xavi after next two games,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barca-President-Laporta-will-only-consider-removing-Xavi-after-next-two-games/3300807,12 Feb,"Barcelona President Joan Laporta is starting to feel the pressure. As his economic levers leave Barcelona desperately searching for finance, and the money they put on the pitch fails to repay their investment, the first sounds of discontent with his management are beginning to be heard.  During the match with Granada, as happened two weeks ago against Villarreal, there were chants from the fans calling out Laportaâs management, as Marca report. Laporta fears that this frustration may continue to grow if the situation does not change, and there is a growing tension in the board. However Laporta will not take any decisions to address their poor form for at least another 10 days. Just over two weeks ago he said that he accepted Xavi Hernandezâs resignation and decision to remain until the end of the season â precisely because of his reputation. Yet Xaviâs announcement has done nothing to revive their form or their results in recent weeks, and if there is no improvement, then Xavi could be pushed out sooner. Sporting Director Deco has already highlighted that Barca Atletic coach Rafael Marquez will only be considered in an emergency, but continued struggles against Celta Vigo away next weekend and then Napoli in the Champions League the following midweek may constitute an emergency. If Barcelona do not react in those matches, Laporta will consider taking decisions ahead of time. Ultimately Xaviâs tenure has served to protect Laporta from criticism for the most part, but as Barcelonaâs season begins to disintegrate, and questions are raised about their transfer and financial policy, Laporta will need to manage the coming months carefully. If he gets the decisions of when to sack Xavi and who to appoint for next season wrong, his own continuity could be in question.","Ultimately Xaviâs tenure has served to protect Laporta from criticism for the most part, but as Barcelonaâs season begins to disintegrate, and questions are raised about their transfer and financial policy, Laporta will need to manage the coming months carefully.

396,Barcelona manager search looking clearer as top target is all but ruled out,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-manager-search-looking-clearer-as-top-target-is-all-but-ruled-out/3301361,14 Feb,"Itâs been a little over two weeks since Barcelona were beaten 5-3 at home by Villarreal, sending the club into a tailspin which was given momentum by Xavi Hernandezâs announcement that he would be leaving at the end of the season. Now though, it looks as if there may be some clarity on his potential successor.  Earlier this week it was reported that President Joan Laporta and Sporting Director Deco had narrowed their shortlist down to just three names, while Hansi Flick and Roberto de Zerbi had been underlined as the favourites for the position. While no decisions have been taken, and nor have serious talks over the position, it would appear that Flick has the clearest path to the job. That is because Matteo Moretto has told The Daily Briefing that de Zerbi is close to impossible for Laporta to secure. In addition to the fact he is financially the most expensive option, de Zerbi is keen to remain in the Premier League as things stand, and believes he will have the chance to do so. It is early on in the search for Xaviâs replacement, and Laporta has a habit of pulling of shock moves, if those two were leading the race, then he will have to change de Zerbiâs mind in order to bring him in. Combined with the fact that Flick is free, and de Zerbi will set Barcelona back in excess of â¬10m, the Blaugrana may wish to exercise financial prudence if they do feel the German coach can do the job.","It is early on in the search for Xaviâs replacement, and Laporta has a habit of pulling of shock moves, if those two were leading the race, then he will have to change de Zerbiâs mind in order to bring him in.

He doubled down on that assessment on Monday.  Los Blancos come off the back of putting down a statement in La Liga, and opening up a five-point gap to the Catalans, to returning to European action in Germany against RB Leipzig. Ancelotti was asked about Vinicius again on Monday though. âIf he achieves that continuity, yes. He has a lot of quality and puts a lot of intensity into his dribbles and sprintsâ¦ If he does it consistently during the 90 minutes, it shows because there are rivals who canât deal with him in the second half,â Ancelotti explained ahead of their clash with RB Leipzig. Vinicius was heavily involved in their win over Girona, scoring a screamer to open the scoring, and inventing a brilliant assist for Jude Bellingham. After that match too, he motivated Vinicius to do so more consistently, claiming when he âplays with the attitudeâ heâs the best in the world. It was also put to him that six months into the season, Real Madrid have lost just twice, and that this might be his best season ever, after significant discussion over whether it was Toni Kroosâ best. âAs a streak, maybe soâ¦ I see a solid, serious, motivated team, with a good atmosphere, no one complains, everyone contributesâ¦ Everything is going well at the moment despite so many difficulties we hadâ¦ It was thanks to character of the players.â Last year Ancelotti was often quick to highlight that the dressing room was one of the best he had possessed as a manager, and later in the press conference would again point to the character of the veterans as a key factor in the smooth transition to the younger generation.","Last year Ancelotti was often quick to highlight that the dressing room was one of the best he had possessed as a manager, and later in the press conference would again point to the character of the veterans as a key factor in the smooth transition to the younger generation."
398,Declan Rice booed as West Ham fans give Arsenal star telling reminder on return,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Declan-Rice-booed-as-West-Ham-fans-give-Arsenal-star-telling-reminder-on-return/3299984,12 Feb,"Declan Riceâs name was jeered as West Ham supporters reminded him he's not in claret and blue anymore on his latest return to the London Stadium.  The England ace spent 10 years on the books in east London before upping sticks to Arsenal in a Â£105million transfer last summer, having captained the Hammers to European glory in his final campaign at the club. Ahead of his first Premier League appearance back at the home of his former side, Riceâs name was the subject of boos and jeers from supporters when it was read out over the tannoy ahead of the game. There is clearly no love lost in the eyes of some, who had no interest in welcoming their former captain back with open arms. The discussion surrounding what sort of reception Rice would get was a hot topic ahead of kick-off, as it has been the previous two times the teams have met this term. Arsenal have already paid the London Stadium a visit once this season, when they were beaten 3-1 and eliminated from the Carabao Cup. Ahead of that clash, Arteta Rice's return, telling reporters: âIt will be his first time back at his old club and a beautiful moment I think for him. ""I think itâs beautiful. I had the experience to do it a few times and then you really see what they think of you and what you left at the club. Itâs a really good way to measure your experience and your reality within the reality of the people who share moments with you."" On that occasion, Riceâs name was met with a similar reception. Although, it must be noted that when he was brought on for the Gunners off the bench, a few cheers of appreciation for his efforts were also audible. There are some Hammers fans who, although he's now long gone, won't hammer a player they once fervently rooted for. A win for Arsenal would go some way to keeping their title hopes alive, while defeat would leave them back at square one after all the joy of last weekâs win over Liverpool. They are again without Emile Smith Rowe, who has suffered a new injury, this time an ankle problem. Arteta confirmed pre-match: ""Emile [Smith-Rowe] turned his ankle in training, so heâs not available. It was too early for Gabi [Jesus] to come back and for him to recover and Jorginho has been struggling with playing 90 minutes in the week. ""Heâs been struggling [with a foot injury] for a while now and he aggravated it after playing 96 minutes at that level. Heâs here to support the team though, thatâs the spirit of Jorgi.""","""Heâs been struggling [with a foot injury] for a while now and he aggravated it after playing 96 minutes at that level.

399,Mohamed Salah RETURNS to Liverpool training for the first time,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mohamed-Salah-RETURNS-to-Liverpool-training-for-the-first-time/3301326,13 Feb,"Liverpool welcomed Mohamed Salah back to first team training for the first time since he sustained a posterior muscle injury in Egypt's unsuccessful Africa Cup of Nations campaign.  The 31-year-old limped off in the closing stages of the group stage match last month, with his subsequent recovery plan causing a major stir back home. The decision was taken for Salah to undergo his rehabilitation back at Kirby, with the plan to return to the nation's camp should the Pharaohs make it to the final stages of the competition in the Ivory Coast. As things transpired, the seven-time winners crashed out of tournament - having only narrowly made it through the first round - in the last-16 to DR Congo on penalties. Salah has continued his recovery in Liverpool and made his first appearance on the training ground on Tuesday ahead of the Premier League trip to Brentford on Saturday afternoon.  The forward looked in good spirits as he joined his teammates, who, despite losing to Arsenal earlier this month, have maintained their bid to secure four trophies this season in his absence. Salah's last game for the Reds came in a 4-2 victory against Newcastle on New Years Day, in which he starred with a brace and an assist. Since then, Jurgen Klopp's side have advanced to the final of the Carabao Cup, after beating Fulham 3-2 across two legs, and secured safe passage into the FA Cup fifth round with wins against the Gunners and Norwich. The league form has also been impressive with three wins, though they did suffer a bruising 3-1 defeat to Mikel Arteta's side which cut their lead at the top over the north Londoners and Manchester City to two points.  Pep Guardiola's team do have a game in hand on the Merseyside club. Still, the likes of Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and particularly Diogo Jota have stood up in his absence, with the Portuguese striker finding the net five times while Salah has been away. Reds fans will eagerly await news of whether their star man will start against the Bees but they can be rest assured he is likely to feature in one way or another.",Reds fans will eagerly await news of whether their star man will start against the Bees but they can be rest assured he is likely to feature in one way or another.
400,Former PSG star tells France to 'BOO' Messi if he returns with Argentina squad,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Former-PSG-star-tells-France-to-BOO-Messi-if-he-returns-with-Argentina-squad/3301650,2 days ago,"Former Paris Saint-Germain and France international Jerome Rothen wants supporters of his previous club to boo Lionel Messi if the Argentinian decides to be part of his nation's upcoming Olympic Games squad.  Messi has the chance to win a second Olympic gold medal after being invited by close-friend and former Barcelona team-mate to be part of Argentina's Under-23 squad for the tournament. Mascherano recently guided the Albiceleste to Olympics qualification following their win over reigning gold medallists Brazil and made a pitch for Messi to be part of the team as an older player. This year's summer Olympics take place in familiar territory for Messi after he spent two-years in the French capital between 2021 and 2023. However, any ideas of a warm welcome back to the nation might have to be put on hold after Rothen's latest demand. 41-year-old Rothen was a mainstay in French football, boasting nearly 300 Ligue 1 appearances with 180 of those at PSG, and fumed that Messi took the 'p***' during his short time at the club.  Explaining the unsavoury reception that France football supporters should give the Rosario-born superstar if he does compete in the Olympics, Rothen stated Messi never showed any respect to his nation. 'We should not forget what he has not given. As a French and a Parisian, seeing him parading with Argentina? Guys, if there is any way to dispute the fact that Messi took the p*** on us for two years, boo him,' Rothen said on his talkshow Rothen s'enflamme. 'He said it would be a disaster to live in Paris and that he hasn't received the welcome he feels he was owed. Nonsense. 'He was above the Eiffel Tower like Neymar was. Every French folk showed him respect when he arrived. You expect respect in return and it never arrived,' he added.   Messi's time at the Qatari-backed PSG saw him seal his ultimate career dream of winning the World Cup with Argentina in a chaotic final against France in 2022. He later returned after a break celebrating back in south America and was met with a confused response from club supporters who were delighted to see him back, but also annoyed that he was responsible for beating France in the final. Rothen continued to criticise Messi, adding: 'When he was given off days, he never experienced Paris to the fullest and his performances never lived up to what we hoped for from him (â¦). 'We heard he was not celebrated accordingly after winning the World Cup. You beat France in the final! He shouldn't have expected to see the red carpet rolled out for him.'",'We heard he was not celebrated accordingly after winning the World Cup. You beat France in the final!

A quarrel flared up between Son and team-mates while they were eating on the eve of their semi-final clash with Jordan, which they lost 2-0 on February 6. Young squad members were reportedly rushing their meal so they could dash off and play table tennis. However, Son was annoyed with them for toddling off early instead of bonding over food and took issue with PSG's Lee-Kang-in, according to the Sun. A war of words descended into a bust-up which left Tottenhan ace Son nursing a dislocated finger.  A source told the Sun: 'The row erupted from nowhere. A few of the younger players ate very quickly and left the rest of the squad to play ping pong 'Son asked them to come back and sit down when some disrespectful things were said to him. 'Within seconds players the row spilled into the dining area and players were being pulled apart. 'Son badly injured his finger trying to calm everyone down.' Son still played in the 2-0 defeat by Jordan on the next day, wearing a bandage on the middle finger on his right hand. South Korea's exit against them was a huge shock, especially considering that Jordan had never even been past the semi-finals before. Son was back on Spurs duty on Saturday, coming off the bench in a 2-1 win over Brighton with the bandage still adorning his finger.","Son was back on Spurs duty on Saturday, coming off the bench in a 2-1 win over Brighton with the bandage still adorning his finger."

Bellingham could be set to miss two or three weeks coming off that injury, but did state on his Instagram that he would be âBack in no timeâ, as part of an Instagram post he put up after the Girona match, relaxing fans about his injury status.

The German giants were beaten 1-0 at Lazio in the Champions League last-16 first-leg clash - with defender Dayot Upamecano being shown a straight red card in the second half. Despite have 17 shots in the match, Bayern failed to muster a single effort on target and were left frustrated following the Italian side's impressive defensive showing. England captain Kane struggled to assert himself in the game and, after the match, was slammed by German media for his performance. In Bild's player ratings, former Tottenham star Kane was given a '6' â with 1 being their best rating and 6 being the worst â after his dismal display.  When describing Kane's performance, the outlet wrote: 'Missed a mega chance after seven minutes, but after that he couldn't connect with Bayern's attacking attempts at all. Totally signed off in the second half'. The only other player to receive a '6' rating was centre-back Upamecano - who was sent off for a rash challenge in the 67th minute. For the Frenchman, they said: 'Clean before halftime. But in the 67th minute, his red-and-penalty foul initiated the debacle.' Elsewhere, Leon Goretzka, Leroy Sane and manager Thomas Tuchel all received a '5' rating, as Bild continued to rip into the Bayern squad. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and playmaker Jamal Musiala received the highest ratings out of all the team, as they walked away from the clash with a '3'. Speaking after the game, Kane himself admitted that the Bavarian giants have not been good enough, given their struggles both domestically and in Europe. The result came four days after they were soundly outplayed at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga in a 3-0 loss - a result that saw them fall five points behind their rivals in the German top-flight. The striker reflected to TNT Sports post-match and said: 'Really tough week. In the first half, we started well and had clear chances, one for myself. In these games, they're big moments. 'The second half was disappointing. We came out with less energy and less confidence. We got punished. Once you go down to 10 men it's always difficult. 'We have to find it among ourselves. We're still in the race for the Bundesliga and still in this tie. We have to keep fighting. 'We're in a difficult spell. We have to fight. We have to turn it around. We have big games and big things to fight for. We're not out of it, we will never give up. We just need to turn it around. One game or spark can turn it around.' Not only were the German side lambasted by their own national media, but they were also criticsed for playing as 'individuals' by Jamie Carragher.   The CBS Sports pundit ripped into Bayern and claimed that their chances of winning the Champions League have been slashed. Asked if the performance and result affect their chances of going on to win the competition, Carragher told CBS Sports: 'I think it does.' He added: 'I said before the game, Bayern Munich, for me, are a team of individuals, not a team right now. You see the face of the manager, Thomas Tuchel, he's going to be under huge pressure. 'And on the back of what happened against Bayer Leverkusen, really poor performance. We saw the same again.

409,Barca following Arsenal forward among 3 options heading shortlist for position,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barca-following-Arsenal-forward-among-3-options-heading-shortlist-for-position/3302130,1 day ago,"Barcelona are looking ahead to next season just two weeks after the January transfer window closed. As ever in Catalonia, their ambitions in the market are high, but questions marks remain over whether their budget will reach as far as their aims.  According to MD, Barcelona see the left-wing position, or the left side of a forward line, as a key position to strengthen in the summer. Their intention is for the club to return broadly to a 4-3-3 structure, and as such, want a more natural option there rather than Joao Felix. They also feel they need someone else with one-on-one ability to beat their defender. There are several options in case Barcelona manage to return to the black in terms of their salary limit, and are not restricted to using half of the money they save or make. The dream is Mohamed Salah of Liverpool, but his price tag makes that dream impossible. They are also following Arsenalâs Gabriel Martinelli closely. The 22-year-old also seems a tricky acquisition given Arsenal have no need to sell, and he has a deal until 2027, even if he brings goal threat and some of the attributes Barcelona desire. Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is another name they like, although he too has a deal until 2027 too. Kvaratskhelia has openly admitted that his dream is to play for Real Madrid, but his agent believes he can earn more elsewhere. Meanwhile Nico Williams, of Athletic Club, has been dropped from their shortlist after he extended his deal until 2027. The reality is that until Barcelona start selling some major pieces of their squad, both of those seem highly improbable in terms of cost and the willingness of their clubs to let them go.","The reality is that until Barcelona start selling some major pieces of their squad, both of those seem highly improbable in terms of cost and the willingness of their clubs to let them go."
410,Gary Neville confident Dan Ashworth could change culture at Manchester United,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Gary-Neville-confident-Dan-Ashworth-could-change-culture-at-Manchester-United/3302793,9 hours ago,"Gary Neville believes Dan Ashworth could be an influential figure as Manchester Unitedâs sporting director, should he make the switch from Newcastle. United are looking to fill the vacancy with an experienced head and are understood to have picked out Ashworth, who has performed similar roles at the Football Association, Brighton and now at St Jamesâ Park. Neville worked with Ashworth when he was Englandâs assistant manager between 2012-2016 and rates the 52-year-old as the kind of leader who could change the culture at Old Trafford, alongside incoming chief executive Omar Berrada. Gary Neville saw the value of Ashworth  âIf Dan does come in, I do think thereâs a chance that the performance mentality will improve, the mentality that they do have, (it) could run through the club quite quickly,â he told Sky Betâs Stick to Football podcast. âIâm not saying Dan is going to be a success at Manchester United, but if youâve got the guy in from Manchester City (Berrada) and now Dan Ashworth, at least youâve got people in roles that belong, as theyâve not had that in the last 10 years. â(With England) he started with the Under-21s, the Under-18s and with the womenâs team. You think of the success of all those teams in recent years, but that has been in the making for eight years, and it all started when Dan came in. âIâm not saying heâs responsible for what happened, but he had a big influence with FA. They were a terrible organisation from a professionalism point of view, and I felt what he did, he put processes in place where theyâre now structured and organised.â Neville also stressed that Ashworth would expect significant power in a new backroom structure led by Ineos chair Sir Jim Ratcliffe, whose deal to acquire a 25 per cent stake in the club could be completed next week. âIâve no doubt that Sir Jim Ratcliffe is trusting in Sir Dave Brailsford in finding the best CEO, the best sporting director, the best head of recruitment and the best coach,â said Neville. âIt looks like theyâve got the first two, and the two yet to be sorted is the head of recruitment and the best coach, but theyâre doing it one by one. I suspect that if Dan Ashworth comes in, heâll want authority at the club to be able to make decisions.â","âIt looks like theyâve got the first two, and the two yet to be sorted is the head of recruitment and the best coach, but theyâre doing it one by one.

On Wednesday Ratcliffe saw his 25 per cent stake in United - to the tune of Â£1.3billion - approved by the Football Association, a move that comes 24 hours after it was ratified by the Premier League. Ratcliffe and his INEOS group will control football operations at Old Trafford and after a meeting with players and first team staff at Carrington recently, Maguire has been left in no doubt that the 71-year-old will transform United into contenders once more. 'I'm sure he's going to have a positive impact on this club,' the centre back told Sky Sports. 'As a player sitting here, I want this club to be successful. I'm sure he's going to play a big part in getting this club back to where it should be.  'It's been a tough few years because the expectation of this club is to challenge for the biggest trophies and to challenge at the top of the Premier League and we haven't done that often enough in the last 10 years. I'm sure he's got a vision of what he wants for this club and I'm sure he'll move it in the right direction.' He added: 'I think the lads came out of the meeting [with Ratcliffe] really impressed with how he spoke. [He] gave us great motivation, everyone in the room, to fight for the club and fight for this badge and to stay on this journey.  'It's exciting times for the club because you can see he's brought that fresh energy. We feel now he will take the club in the right direction.' Ratcliffe and INEOS are looking to overhaul United's fortunes on the pitch by freshening things up off it. Omar Berrada is currently on gardening leave after being poached from Man City to be the new CEO, while a move to make Dan Ashworth United's inaugural sporting director is edging closer.","Omar Berrada is currently on gardening leave after being poached from Man City to be the new CEO, while a move to make Dan Ashworth United's inaugural sporting director is edging closer."
412,Real Madrid and Brazil national team: How Carlo Ancelottiâs future shifted over 12 months,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Madrid-and-Brazil-national-team-How-Carlo-Ancelotti%E2%80%99s-future-shifted-over-12-months/3301371,14 Feb,"There was massive speculation in the football world about the future of Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti. After Real Madrid lost El Clasico and were effectively knocked out of the title race in 2023, many predicted he would depart Real Madrid, while then Brazilian Football Confederation President Ednaldo Rodrigues said he would be taking over the Selecao two months later.  In this post, weâll discuss the key indicators pointing to Ancelottiâs future down the line. The experts working with LeafletCasino for detailed online casino and betting site reviews have extensively researched the events around the coach. Carlo Ancelotti has been involved in managerial duties for over 30 years. His career kicked off as an assistant coach at the Italian national club in 1992, and from there, he moved to Reggiana. Since his debut as a coach, Don Carlo has worked with many top teams, including Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, PSG, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid. His first Real Madrid contract was in 2013. The Italian stayed for two years before leaving for Bayern Munich in 2015. He rejoined the Spanish side in 2021 and has remained the clubâs coach. Throughout his career, Carlo Ancelotti has a record of massive success. Thereâs no surprise heâs considered one of the best coaches in the football world. Ancelotti holds the record for the first and only coach to have won league titles across the top five leagues in Europe. He won the Serie A with AC Milan, the EPL with Chelsea, the Ligue 1 with PSG, the Bundesliga with Bayern, and La Liga with Real Madrid. Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti was awarded the best UEFA coach of the 2021/22 season. That was the first time heâd won the award. However, the Italian coach also thrice won the IFFHS Worldâs Best Club Coach award. Don Carlo is the first coach in football history to win four Champions League titles. He won the first two seasons with AC Milan in 2002/03 and 2006/07. Then, with Madrid, he won the European Club Tournament in the 2013/14 and 2021/22 seasons. Also, on five occasions, Ancelotti was the first coach to reach the finals of the European club competition. He only lost against Liverpool in the 2004/05 season. In his current second spell with the club in the Spanish capital, Don Carlo won a whopping seven trophies. He only won four in his first spell. His recent performances with Madrid were the primary reason the Brazil football team was interested in him.  When Carlo Ancelottiâs Real Madrid contract was set to end in 2024âs summer, rumours were that heâd take the international route. The Brazil national team was at the forefront of landing the Italian manager. The news was directly confirmed by the CBF President Rodrigues. The plan was that Fernando Diniz would serve as a temporary coach until Ancelotti took charge in the summer of 2024. Notably, the Brazilians hoped Ancelotti would lead them to the Copa America in the United States. Also, he would subsequently guide them through the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Brazil football team had been without a permanent manager since Titeâs departure after the World Cup in November. As a result, Ancelotti was a top priority. Don Carlo has experience coaching key Brazilian players like Vinicius Junior, Eder Militao, and Rodrygo Goes at Madrid. So, it would have been easy for him to fit with the squad quickly. In July 2023, Rodrigues shared details of Ancelottiâs anticipated arrival at a press conference. According to him, the coach had communicated his availability. At the time, the news made headlines around the football world. Everyone was almost sure that Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti would leave the club at the end of his contract. However, Ancelotti himself didnât publicly confirm the details. Madrid was in the preseason while the rumours were ongoing. So, it was understandable that he didnât want to cause friction with the club. It would have raised questions about his commitment to the Spanish Giants if he had made any supportive comments. Of course, that could have potentially impacted his teamâs early-season performance. It was depressing news for Brazil football fans when Don Carlo finally renewed his contract with Madrid in the Spanish capital. The report came out on December 29th, when Madrid released a confirmation statement. With the pen out to paper, the Italian coach is set to remain with them for two more years until June 2026. Having sealed his contract extension, Carlo Ancelotti continues to perform at Los Blancos. With 23 matches played so far, Madrid is in a position to lift the La Liga trophy again. The club boasts a ten-point lead over their eternal rival, FC Barcelona. Ancelotti won his 11th trophy for Madrid in late January in the Supercopa, as Real Madrid beat Barcelona with a commanding 4-1 victory in the final, skillful Brazilian Vinicius Jr scoring a hat-trick in just 40 minutes. Furthermore, Real Madrid qualified for the Round of 16 of the Champions League for the umpteenth time. The club will be looking to extend their record as the most successful side in the tournamentâs history. Itâs worth noting that the Spanish side have never won a treble in their history. Perhaps, Ancelotti has his eyes set on achieving that record before he finally calls it quits with Los Blancos. Having failed to secure Carlo Ancelotti, the Brazil football team appointed a different manager choosing Dorival Junior as a new manager for their menâs national team. Hailing from Araraquara in Sao Paulo, the 61-year-old coach recently led Sao Paulo to victory in the 2023 Brazilian Cup. Now, his new job is to guide his country at the upcoming 2024 Copa America. While he may not be Don Carlo, Dorival boasts an extensive coaching career. He has worked with prominent Brazilian clubs such as Flamengo, Fluminense, and Santos. Notably, he achieved continental success by leading Flamengo to victory in 2022âs Copa Libertadores. His coaching accolades include winning the 2010 Brazilian Cup and the state league with Santos.","While he may not be Don Carlo, Dorival boasts an extensive coaching career.

413,Dominic King: Kane looked 'bereft' after Leverkusen dented his silverware bid,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Dominic-King-Kane-looked-bereft-after-Leverkusen-dented-his-silverware-bid/3300896,13 Feb,"Harry Kane looked 'bereft' after Bayern Munich were dismantled by Bundesliga title rivals Bayer Leverkusen, claims Mail Sport's Dominic King, with the forward at risk of missing out on silverware again.  Leverkusen blew the reigning champions away on Saturday night with their 3-0 win extending their lead to five points at the top of the table. On-loan midfielder Josip Stanisic struck against his parent club, with Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong sealing victory. The result raises the prospect that Kane's wait for the first silverware of his career could continue, with Bayern at risk of missing out on the German title for the first time since 2012. King, who watched the match at the BayArena, told Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast that Kane's demeanour at full-time was similar to previous heartbreaking defeats with both Tottenham and England.   âI've written about Harry Kane in terms of how he looked at the final whistle,' King said. âIt just struck a chord with me of how he looked in Moscow when England went out of the World Cup finals in 2018, how he looked the following year in Madrid when Tottenham had lost the Champions League final. He just looked absolutely bereft.' King added that Thomas Muller's explosive post-match interview suggested there are currently issues in the Bayern Munich dressing room. German outlet BILD gave a scathing review of Kane's performance, labelling the Â£100m striker's display as a 'catastrophe', while a headline to one article read: 'The Kane disaster'. King insisted the criticism of the Bundesliga's top scorer is 'totally unfair', with Bayern's problems lying elsewhere in the team. âThat's ridiculously unfair to make him the reference point for what happened on Saturday. If they're only doing that because of his price tag, then it's absolutely unfair,' King said. âThere were so many people over the pitch who were just miserable. The tactics that Bayern had were confusing. They didn't really know whether they were playing a back four or a back three at times. â[Dayot] Upamecano, the central defender, was all over the place. Eric Dier looked absolutely bereft of confidence and unsure and Harry Kane got no service. âI think he touched the ball 17 or 18 times and just got no opportunities to cause any problems.   'There was one point, I made a note of it, when he was trying to sort of beckon his team-mates forward and encourage them and there was nobody listening to him. âLiterally nobody looking at him as he was saying this in the second half. âI felt sorry for him really, because what a story this would be if he'd gone to the club that he thought where he was going to be guaranteed medals and ended up winning nothing this year.' Bayern Munich face an uphill battle if they are to win a 12th consecutive Bundesliga title, despite Kane netting 24 goals in 21 league matches this season. It's All Kicking Off host Ian Ladyman believes that Kane, despite his goalscoring exploits in the Bundesliga, made a mistake by moving to Bayern last summer. 'I said at the start of the season that Kane should have stayed at Tottenham, seen out the last year as contract, and then he could have moved to anywhere,' Ladyman said.  âHe could have moved to Manchester United, maybe he could have moved to Liverpool, could have moved, who knows? Manchester City might have fancied another world-class striker on a free transfer. âInstead, he went to Bayern, where admittedly, he has looked like he's been having the time of his life, scored goals, great form, embracing the lifestyle, but he went there for medals and at the moment he's in danger of not getting one.â Bayern will seek to bounce back from their defeat to Leverkusen in the Champions League.

415,Leverkusen star Tella once beat Brooklyn Beckham to an Arsenal scholarship,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Leverkusen-star-Tella-once-beat-Brooklyn-Beckham-to-an-Arsenal-scholarship/3301632,2 days ago,"NATHAN TELLA once beat Brooklyn Beckham to an Arsenal scholarship.  Brooklyn Beckham posted on social media a photo of himself and fellow Arsenal youngsters, including Nathan Tella Now the former Gunner is helping Bayer Leverkusen close in on an historic Bundesliga title.  But the journey to the top of the table in Germany has been far from smooth for Tella. The Stevenage-born winger signed scholar's terms with Arsenal in 2015 when he was 15, with Brooklyn, the oldest son of David and Victoria Beckham, among those to miss out. Just two years later, however, Tella's 10-year stay at Arsenal also came to an end. An injury at the start of the 2016/17 season cost him his place in the Gunners' under-18 side.  And competition from the likes of Emile Smith Rowe and Reiss Nelson for positions out wide led to the club telling Tella that he would not be offered a professional deal. So the youngster moved to Southampton where, after steady progress through the ranks, he made his first-team debut against Norwich in June 2020 during the Covid-19-interrupted season. Tella seemed to have made his breakthrough in the second half of 2020/1 campaign and signed a new three-and-a-half-year deal at St Mary's in January 2022. But the following summer he was sent on loan to Championship side Burnley.  And in a sensational reversal of fortune, Tella had a stellar season as the Clarets and the Saints swapped divisions. Tella was named in the Championship Team of the Season after finishing top scorer for Vincent Kompany's side, with 17 goals in 39 league appearances, as they returned to the top flight as champions. After Burnley confirmed promotion, Tella said: âIt's been my favourite season. âI've learnt so much from the boys and the team and the staff and playing in front of these fans and it's meant a lot to me. âI'm just happy that we were able to bring home the silverware and do it for them.â But Tella is on the verge of having an even better season with Leverkusen. He was hugely popular at Southampton and the club was hoping and expecting him to be part of new boss Russell Martin's new-lookd side. But when Leverkusen came in with a bid worth a reported Â£20m, it was too good for the Saints to turn down and Tella leapt at the chance to try his luck in Germany.   Another new arrival at Leverkusen helped the 24-year-old settle in to his new life - former Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka. Tella said: ""When he left Arsenal in the summer it really upset me as a fan of the club. ""He was incredibly important to the team. Then suddenly playing alongside him four weeks later â crazy! That was a fast emotional change for me. ""He really helped me a lot from my first day and told me all about the team and the players. ""His approach and that of the other lads made it easy for me to quickly feel at home in this new environment and I haven't regretted taking this big step."" Tella initially struggled for game time in the Bundesliga but featured in all six of the club's Europa League group games and earned a first senior call-up from Nigeria.  Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso said: âNathan is a player that has the ability to just do the right thing, be in the right place,â Alonso said. âHe has the quality to be in the box and makes the right runs.â Tella missed out on Nigeria's squad for the recent African Cup of Nations. But in recent weeks he has made an impact in Leverkusen's quest for a first ever German title. Tella has scored three goals in his last four Bundesliga games and produced an assist in the convincing 3-0 win over closest rivals Bayern Munich at the weekend. Alonso, whose side are five points clear of Bayern with 13 games to go, said: âNathan is getting better every game. ""His talent creates problems for any defence and he is so important to how we play.""  Axed by Arsenal, saved by Southampton, boosted by Burnley and now loving it with Leverkusen - Tella's road to the top is a lesson in perseverance and self-belief.","Axed by Arsenal, saved by Southampton, boosted by Burnley and now loving it with Leverkusen - Tella's road to the top is a lesson in perseverance and self-belief."
416,OFFICIAL: Klinsmann SACKED as South Korea coach after only 12 months in charge,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/OFFICIAL-Klinsmann-SACKED-as-South-Korea-coach-after-only-12-months-in-charge/3302787,9 hours ago,"Jurgen Klinsmann has been sacked as South Korea head coach after only 12 months in the role, following their shock Asian Cup semi-final defeat to Jordan.  The German was appointed in February on a deal that ran until the end of the 2026 World Cup. However, amid reports of in-fighting in the camp ahead of their defeat to Jordan earlier this month, which prolonged the nation's 64-year draught in the competition, the former Tottenham striker has been relieved of his duties. Hwang Bo-kwan, the technical director of the Korea Football Association (KFA) spoke to reporters after a meeting of an advisory committee on Thursday and advised that the German should no longer continue in the role. He said: 'We've reached a consensus that Klinsmann cannot exercise his leadership as national team head coach for various reasons and that a change of leadership is necessary.  On the eve of their loss to the side ranked 64 places below them in the world, captain Son Heung-min dislocated a finger after an altercation with a team-mate. A quarrel flared up between Son and team-mates while they were eating before the game against Jordan, which they lost 2-0 on February 6. Reports claimed that a number of young players in the squad had rushed eating their meal so they could dash off and play table tennis which infuriated Son, with the situation further escalating from there. However, more details have since emerged on what exactly transpired that night which saw the South Korea and Spurs captain walk away with a nasty finger injury. South Korea's Yonhap news agency first reported that Son initially tried to talk to the younger players â including PSG starlet Lee Kang-in â about bonding with their team-mates instead of rushing off to play table tennis. The incident then turned physical when they refused to listen to their skipper, which saw a furious Son grab Lee. In a moment of madness, the PSG forward tried to punch Son in retaliation before the two players had to be pulled apart. During the fracas, Son dislocated his finger on his right hand and was seen sporting a bandage the next day for the match.  Klinsmann's popularity plummeted during the tournament, with many fans and some politicians criticising the 59-year-old's demeanour. Klinsmann also faced repeated backlash for working from his home in Los Angeles, despite saying he would spend much of his time in South Korea - a move which was seen as 'disrespectful' by insiders. He won the 1990 World Cup as a player, before becoming a manager of the Germany and USA national sides, as well as Bundesliga titans Bayern Munich. After Klinsmann's takeover last year, South Korea failed to win any of his first five games in charge, with two defeats and three draws, but they did pick up six consecutive wins heading into the Asian Cup. Hong Myung-bo, a former sweeper for the national side, is reportedly among the names being considered as a temporary replacement if Klinsmann is dismissed.","Hong Myung-bo, a former sweeper for the national side, is reportedly among the names being considered as a temporary replacement if Klinsmann is dismissed."

The Basque forward is facing a late fitness test to see if he will be fit for the first leg in Paris.  The Txuri-Urdin will be desperate to have their leader back for a clash which sees them in their worst moment of form. La Real have not scored in their last four matches, and have recorded just one league win in their last nine. â[PSG] have a great team, with a squad, with a great coach and, no doubt many of them are thinking that if La Real have a great day, they could even surprise us,â Imanol Alguacil told Cadena Cope ahead of the game. If Oyarzabal is not fit, then Takefusa Kubo and Ander Barrenetxea are likely to  be playing off one of Umar Sadiq or Andre Silva. Alguacil spoke highly of Luis Enrique, calling him their âMbappe on the benchâ. âThere is no doubt that PSG has a squad to be a finalist and with a coach who also knows us very well, whom I admire a lot. I know that he is a coach who likes to push high and who likes to take the initiative, which which we like to do too.â The big question mark for La Real is whether forward and captain Mikel Oyarzabal will be fit, as he tries to race back following a muscle injury. âIf you asked me the question after training, I could no doubt answer betterâ¦ Well, tomorrow we will no longer have any doubts.â âIf he has traveled it is because he has a chance. Yesterday he was able to do a bit more, today he will no doubt do a little more than that. It will depend on how it evolves and, if there is any game in which you have to put all your effort in, it will be tomorrowâs. Thatâs what I can tell you.â Real Sociedad will need to rise to the occasion againt PSG. During the group stage, La Real had the best defence in the competition, conceding just twice and going unbeaten in a group that featured finalists last year Inter. The sense is that an unreliable PSG and the Txuri-Urdin have been in different directions of travel since though. Ahead of the match Luis Enrique praised their good work and their use of academy players.","Real Sociedad will need to rise to the occasion againt PSG.

Bayer Leverkusen prevailed with a 3-0 victory, with Stanisic amongst the scorers. The 23-year-old is on a season-long loan from Bayern, who he joined as a youth player in 2017. Whereas in the Premier League players who are on loan are not permitted to play against their parent clubs, that rule doesn't apply in the Bundesliga. Former Chelsea manager Tuchel expressed his bewilderment that such a scenario is allowed to happen. Tuchel said: 'In England there's a nice rule where when you loan a player out, they can't play against you. For me that makes more sense. The rule unfortunately doesn't exist in Germany'.  Stanisic has made 41 senior appearances for Bayern and has won the Bundesliga three times with the club. The Croatia international performed a muted celebration after scoring the opening goal of the game against Bayern. Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong were also on the scoresheet as Bayer Leverkusen moved five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Stanisic, who was born in Munich, has made 20 appearances so far this season while on loan at Bayer. ",

Ten Hag knows he must deliver Champions League football if he is to hang on to his job beyond the summer. Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken control of football operations and not even winning the FA Cup in 2016 could save Louis van Gaal from the sack when he missed out on the top four. Ratcliffe is busy putting the building blocks in place to reshape United after years in the wilderness and Ten Hag must prove over the remainder of the campaign that he can be part of that future. United jumped above West Ham into sixth when they beat the Hammers at Old Trafford last Sunday and they can close to within five points of fourth-placed Villa if they win at Villa Park on Sunday. The game is huge for United and Ten Hag has not shied away from telling his players how important the run-in is for them. âIâve said to the team from the start of January that every game is now a final,â said the United boss. âThat was also our approach to West Ham United, and we were one point behind them, so this is a final. So letâs take on this challenge. We have to see this as a final. That will be every game from now on, for us. Weâre already in that mood.â United achieved their result of the season when they battled back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 against Villa on Boxing Day at Old Trafford. That victory has been a catalyst for their campaign and they have lost just one of their last six games. Their five-match unbeaten run is their best of their testing season and they have banged in 11 goals in winning their last three matches. Youngsters Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo are delivering goals and Ten Hag feels his team is finally playing how he wants. Ten Hag knows Villa Park will be the acid test of Unitedâs mini-revival and Unai Emeryâs side have lost just one league game at home all season. The Dutchman is impressed by the transformation Emery has engineered at Villa and knows his side have to be at their best to win. âItâs very good how he develops this team and itâs very clear how they want to play in and out of possession,â he said. âI think the players know exactly what they have to do, their jobs and how they have to contribute with each other. Theyâre a really good team and they have weapons in their team. We have to play our maximum levels to get the result.â","âItâs very good how he develops this team and itâs very clear how they want to play in and out of possession,â he said. âI think the players know exactly what they have to do, their jobs and how they have to contribute with each other.

421,Eddie Howe fears Man United's Dan has too much access to Newcastle's secrets,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Eddie-Howe-fears-Man-Uniteds-Dan-has-too-much-access-to-Newcastles-secrets/3302819,7 hours ago,"Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has called for a speedy resolution to sporting director Dan Ashworth's future, amid fears the Manchester United target could leak vital information due to having too much 'intelligence' when it comes to the club's transfer targets.  Ashworth has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford with new United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe identifying him as his ideal candidate, and Mail Sport exclusively revealed earlier this week that an agreement for him to join the Red devils is likely to be reached early next week. But Newcastle have a match before then, as they are set host Bournemouth tomorrow, and Howe wants more clarity on Ashworth's position. When asked if he wanted a solution as quickly as possible, Howe replied: 'It is better for everybody if that is the case. 'That's why I say he is in a position of power and there's a lot of intelligence and information, that is why it is a slightly unusual situation.'   Howe was pushed further on whether he has received any assurances from Ashworth that he wants to stay at Newcastle, and issued a one-word response: 'No'. However, he added that as far as he is aware, United are yet to make a formal approach for the highly-rated 52-year-old who has also thrived in similar roles with the FA and Brighton. 'Nothing as far as I'm aware,' Howe said when asked if there had been direct contact between the two Premier League clubs. 'Obviously, it's been in the news a lot and usually with these things that means something is going to happen. 'But as we speak now, we've had no contact. It's an unusual situation. I'm used to speculation around players but this is different.' He also insisted that Newcastle would be able to cope if Ashworth left, denying it would be a major setback for the club. 'Football always moves on very quickly, and I'd say that regarding the manager's position,' Howe continued. 'Newcastle is a huge football club, it will continue to work in a very efficient way regardless of who is here. 'We've got some very, very capable people here in all departments, so we would carry on very smoothly.' More to follow...",More to follow...

Ange Postecoglou has received much praise for the work that he has done since being appointed as Tottenham manager. Tottenham, who were top of the table in October, are currently in fourth place and Ferguson feels that they will never win the title. The last time that Tottenham won the league was in the 1960-61 campaign, when when Bill Nicholson was in charge. Ferguson won the league a remarkable 13 times as United manager before retiring in 2013.  Asked by Sky Sports Racing's Matt Chapman whether Tottenham will ever win the Premier League, Ferguson responded by saying: 'No' before laughing. Ferguson continued: '1961 was the last time they won it. That's a long time. The proposition today with Liverpool and Man City being so powerful in the Premier League.' The 82-year-old was being interviewed at Newbury racecourse, where his horse Protektorat came third in the Betfair Denman Chase. When it was suggested by Chapman that Tottenham are more likely to win the league than United, Ferguson said: 'No chance'. Ferguson once famously said: 'Lads, it's Tottenham' as his team talk when facing the north London club at home. Tottenham beat Brighton 2-1 at home on Saturday, with Brennan Johnson scoring a late equaliser. ",

Asked if Inter's midfield the strongest in the world, the German also said: ""Yes, because of the way they work for each other, everyone knows how to stay on the pitch at all times. You can see that they are well trained, in a precise system in which even the youngest ones can immediately fit in: one of the 'pluses' is precisely the coach who gave a soul.

It opens the door for the 24-year-old world class forward to finally join Real Madrid, who have been after him for several years.  Although no agreement has been reached with Mbappe as of yet, Real Madrid are said to be very confident of closing an agreement soon. As per Relevo, club officials expect everything to be finalised in a matter of weeks, as Mbappe has already given his word to Los Blancos that he wants to join. Furthermore, the report notes that Mbappe actually came to his decision to leave PSG several weeks ago, although it was only communication to Nasser al-Khelaifi, the clubâs president, in the last few days. For now, Mbappeâs full focus is on PSG, whom he hopes to help finally win the Champions League as his last act. Real Madrid are continuing to work towards an agreement of personal terms, but itâs highly likely that Florentino Perez will finally get his man at the umpteenth time of asking.","For now, Mbappeâs full focus is on PSG, whom he hopes to help finally win the Champions League as his last act.

The 26-year-old is reportedly under offer from Barcelona, who hope to agree a new contract on reduced wages, although if that fails to happen, there is a chance that he is sold on in the summer.  The sale of de Jong would significantly help Barcelonaâs ongoing financial woes, although they would be losing one of their most influential players from the last few seasons. If the Dutch midfielder was to be put up for sale, itâs unlikely that he would be short of suitors, especially from the Premier League. Manchester United and Chelsea have both been credited with an interest in de Jong, and according to Football Insider, they have a âreal advantageâ over clubs from other leagues, as the likelihood is that English clubs are the only ones that would be able to meet Barcelonaâs demands. At this stage, itâs not overly clear what de Jongâs stance is on leaving. He has spoken of his commitment to Barcelona over the last couple of years, but thatâs not top say that he has altered his mindset now.","At this stage, itâs not overly clear what de Jongâs stance is on leaving.

429,"Who could PSG sign to replace MbappÃ©? Salah, Osimhen, Silva...",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Who-could-PSG-sign-to-replace-Mbapp%C3%A9-Salah-Osimhen-Silva.../3302808,8 hours ago,"In France a number of names are already circulating, with the current superstar having confirmed his end of season departure.  The only positive aspect of Paris Saint-Germain already knowing what Kylian MbappÃ© will do next season, i.e. not continuing in Paris, is that the club now has ample room to shape the project for the upcoming summer market. The Parisian outfit didnât want the decision to linger on until May, as it did two years ago, in order to plan without the presence of the French international. So, as news emerged on Thursday that the forward had informed the president, Nasser Al KhelaÃ¯fi, on Tuesday morning that he wouldnât be extending his contract in the French capital, thoughts quickly turned to replacements. Now, Paris Saint-Germain must tackle the most difficult task: finding that player, which seems to many as impossible â unless they could somehow convince Erling Haaland â and building a competitive team for the years to come. The club remains confident, however, and doesnât view his departure as a tragedy. Those in charge remain committed to the continuity of the project initiated last year, following the departures of Neymar, Messi, and Ramos, which focused on recruiting young talents, prioritizing French players (including ZaÃ¯re-Emery, the gem of the academy), and moving away from the galÃ¡ctico signings that illuminated Paris for over a decade. The first name circulating in France is Victor Osimhen. The 26-year-old forward was signed by Luis Campos, PSGâs current sporting advisor, for Lille, and wouldnât be averse to returning to French football, as indicated by LâÃquipe. However, competition for the Nigerian is fierce, with several suitors in the English Premier League, and he hasnât hidden his desire to play there. Two other names that are causing a stir at Barcelona are Gavi and De Jong, both players are highly regarded by Luis Enrique. Another player on the radar is Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian has been a long-standing dream for Qatar to expand the clubâs image in the Middle East. With a contract until 2025, the Liverpool forward could pack his bags in the summer after failing to reach an agreement on his renewal. Saudi Arabia, which has him as a target, emerges as a strong competitor, offering financial conditions that could surpass those offered by PSG. But Ligue 1 and Champions League will maintain his sporting integrity. Bernardo Silva is yet another option being considered by PSGâs sporting management to try to compensate for MbappÃ©'s departure. Last season, during the summer transfer window, Luis Campos, who also signed him along with Osimhen, but for Monaco, explored his acquisition, but Manchester City demanded â¬150 million (c.$162m). Recently renewed, the Portuguese playmaker now has a â¬60 million (c.$65m) release clause, a figure more than feasible for the French club, which, according to reports, will save â¬200 million (c.$215m) gross without their current Frenchman on the books. Others like Kimmich, Gavi, and Bruno Guimaraes are emerging as three players that PSG wants to strengthen their midfield. The German, with a contract until 2025, was previously approached by the club in winter during negotiations for Mukieleâs transfer, but Bayern remained firm in discussions. Gavi, whom Luis Enrique knows from his time with the national team, is a likely impossible dream, but PSG could leverage Barcelonaâs financial situation to add pressure. Guimaraes is a preference of Luis Enrique, according to LâÃquipe. The French newspaper also highlights that PSG is immersed in the battle for Leny Yoro, a target for Real Madrid. The 18-year-old French defender has emerged as one of the most promising center-backs in European football, attracting interest from the continentâs top clubs. With a contract until 2025, the proximity between Jorge Mendes and Luis Campos could play a key role in tipping the scales in favor of the French team, although Lille is reluctant to sell due to the strained relationship between Olivier Letang and Campos. PSG has plenty of time to build a competitive team to partially, because completely is impossible, compensate for Kylian MbappÃ©'s departure in June. If Qatar has shown anything in recent years, itâs that it knows how to counter when one of its stars leaves. However, the project is now different, focusing on strengthening the collective rather than attracting big stars that require exorbitant sums of money. Paris enters a new dimension without its star, its prodigy, the forward who has been the focal point of football in the last five years.","PSG has plenty of time to build a competitive team to partially, because completely is impossible, compensate for Kylian MbappÃ©'s departure in June.

430,Mourinho reveals he IS in favour of blue cards despite proposed plans backlash,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mourinho-reveals-he-IS-in-favour-of-blue-cards-despite-proposed-plans-backlash/3302508,18 hours ago,"Jose Mourinho has revealed he is in favour of the proposed blue card being introduced into the Premier League, provided it stops players missing games for an accumulation of yellow cards.  Plans for a blue card would see 10-minute sin-bins trialled during games â in what would be the first new card added to the professional game since yellows and reds were brought in for the 1970 World Cup. The initiative was set to see players sent to a 10-minute sin-bin for cynical fouls and showing dissent towards officials, in a rule similar to yellow cards being shown in rugby. Receiving a blue and a yellow, or two blues, will have the same result as two yellows, and see players sent off. The blue card is being considered by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), but a planned announcement last week was cancelled amid a furore of backlash at the idea.  A host of Premier League managers fumed at the decision believing it wouldn't be good for modern day football, however, Mourinho - although tentative - is in support of the new card being brought in to dish out mid-match punishment. 'I think there is always a feeling of changing things, I'm not always sure you change for better,' JosÃ© Mourinho, Football.com Global ambassador told FIVE. 'I think if the sinbin means you're out for certain number of minutes but then not an accumulation of it and can play next match without suspension or five yellows I would say so. 'Something I never understand very well is from accumulation of yellow cards a payer cannot play one match, clubs pay players to play, players want to play, fans want players to play, you cannot play for accumulation of yellow cards. 'If there is something that takes it out I say yes and probably more fair than if you make a mistake or infraction in match then you pay it in that match it maybe makes sense and gives team a difficulty to deal with in that specific match.   'You are out and have to play with one man less for 10 minutes ok lets go, I wouldn't dislike I would say,' he added. Current Premier League rules around yellow cards states players will be suspended for one game if they receive five yellow cards during the the first 19 games of the season. They will then be banned for a further two games if 10 yellow cards are picked up before the 32nd game of the season. All three parts of the interview will be available on FIVEâs YouTube. The full interview with JosÃ© Mourinho will be available on @FIVEUK"" >@FIVEUKâs audio platforms, Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts.","All three parts of the interview will be available on FIVEâs YouTube. The full interview with JosÃ© Mourinho will be available on @FIVEUK"" >@FIVEUKâs audio platforms, Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts."
431,Lazio 1-0 Bayern: Tuchel's team faced more frustration with Immobile's penalty,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Lazio-1-0-Bayern-Tuchels-team-faced-more-frustration-with-Immobiles-penalty/3301721,1 day ago,"Defeat, a red card and another night of frustration. The pressure is growing on Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel and Harry Kane's best chance of a trophy may be slipping away.  Bayern should have beaten Lazio comfortably in the first leg of this last 16 tie but Kane, among others, were guilty of wasting chance after chance before Ciro Immobile's 69th minute penalty gave the Italians victory. Dayot Upamecano, who brought down Gustav Isaksen for the spot-kick, was sent off and will miss the second leg in Munich. It is no surprise Tuchel had his head in his hands in the dugout. His team had 16 shots but not a single one found the target. Bayern had come into this tie off the back of defeat by Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen, which left them five points adrift at the top of the Bundesliga table. Kane, who had just three touches in Lazio's box last night, admitted it had been a 'really tough' week.  'We're in a difficult spell, there's no hiding that, but we have to fight and we have to turn it around,' Kane said. 'In the first half we had some clear chances. In these games, they're big moments and we weren't able to take them. 'The second half was disappointing. We came out with less energy and less confidence. 'Ultimately, we got punished. We're still in the race for the Bundesliga, still in this tie. We will never give up. We have to keep fighting and try and turn our momentum around.' Bayern should have taken the lead on multiple occasions but were wasteful in front of goal. Joshua Kimmich sliced a shot wide from inside the box in just the second minute. Then it was Kane's turn to miss the target. The forward was picked out in the box by Thomas Muller but lost his balance, sending a wayward effort over the bar from seven yards out. Bayern continued to create the best opportunities and went close again when a well-worked free-kick resulted in Leroy Sane firing a shot inches wide of the left post. Another huge chance came just before the half-time whistle when Jamal Musiala danced his way through the box before lifting his shot over the crossbar. Lazio were better in the second half and should have opened the scoring when Isaksen was played through by Alberto, but the forward's heavy touch allowed Manuel Neuer to make an important save.    The Italians had grown into the game and, with 21 minutes to go, were awarded a penalty after a moment of madness from Upamecano. Immobile dribbled his way through the Bayern defence before laying the ball off to Isaksen. His shot flew wide but the forward was caught by the studs of Upamecano after the ball had gone. Referee Francois Letexier pointed to the spot and, deeming the defender had used excessive force, brandished a red card. Immobile stepped up to calmly convert into the bottom right corner. A statement from Bayern at full-time condemned racist abuse which had been directed to Upamecano on social media following his mistake. 0' The match is about to start!  2' CHANCE!

432,Arteta believes that Arsenal should be 'in the conversation' with Mbappe,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arteta-believes-that-Arsenal-should-be-in-the-conversation-with-Mbappe/3302809,8 hours ago,"Mikel Arteta believes that Arsenal should be 'in the conversation' as Kylian Mbappe decides on his next club as he departs PSG at the end of the season.  The French superstar has been at the centre of an incredibly lucrative tug of war between the Parisians and Real Madrid for several years, that finally looks set to come to a conclusion. Carlo Ancelotti's side are expected to add the World Cup winner to their impressive roster next term after he informed PSG that he will leave when his contract expires. It has also been interpreted as a clear signal Mbappe is prepared to drop his financial demands. That has not stopped reports linking the striker with a move to the Emirates or their Premier League rivals Liverpool. Speaking ahead of the Gunners' clash against Burnely on Saturday, Arteta chose not to shy away from the matter but hinted at the striker's likely destination.  'Well, when there is a player of that calibre we always have to be in the conversation.' The Arsenal manager said on Friday. 'But as you said, it looks  to be going a different way. According to The Independent, Mbappe would be open to signing for the north Londoners but the Gunners aren't prepared to break their financial strategy in order to facilitate a deal. A switch would mean following in the footsteps of legendary fellow Frenchman Thierry Henry. Henry scored a club record 228 goals for the Gunners and was a key part of the club's famous Invincibles side that won the Premier League title in 2003-04 without losing a single game. Mbappe has often been compared to Henry throughout is career, with both players having made their senior breakthrough at Monaco. During his time at PSG, Mbappe has scored a hugely impressive 242 goals in 289 appearances. Mail Sport understands Madrid are willing to make Mbappe the club's top earner, surpassing the Â£10.3m per season they pay Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior.   They will also pay a signing-on fee of around Â£85.5m and open talks over what percentage of his image rights he retains. The player's mother Fayza Lamari wants Madrid to abandon their usual 50-50 split between club and player and Madrid president Florentino Perez is likely to cede to those demands. Mbappe is expected to take the No 10 shirt that Luka Modric will vacate in the summer. His arrival would give Madrid a forward line of Mbappe, Vinicius and Rodrygo, supported by Bellingham.","Mbappe is expected to take the No 10 shirt that Luka Modric will vacate in the summer.

434,Stats show why Man Utd's Â£72m striker Rasmus Hojlund is FINALLY scoring freely,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Stats-show-why-Man-Utds-%C2%A372m-striker-Rasmus-Hojlund-is-FINALLY-scoring-freely/3300812,12 Feb,"Manchester United star Rasmus Hojlund has finally begun finding his form in-front of goal and, after looking at the stats, it's clear to see why.  The Danish international endured a rough opening period to life in Manchester following his Â£72million move from Atalanta in the summer. Despite finding the back of the net in Europe, Hojlund went months without scoring in the league for United - until eventually bagging against Aston Villa in December. Mail Sport's Chris Sutton had previously claimed that the Danish striker was suffering from a lack of service at United - which may since changed in recent months. Here, with the help of SofaScore, Mail Sport takes a look at how the Danish international has managed to turn his goalscoring fortunes around.  It'll be no secret that one of Hojlund's main issues was the lack of service that he received up-front from his Manchester United team-mates. In the run up to the Christmas period, thanks to our friends at StatsPerform, we can see that the Danish star received 14.8 passes per 90 minutes from those around him. However, since December 25th, we can see that the 21-year-old has in fact been receiving more passes during a match than he had previously. Hojlund now, on average, receives the ball 15.9 times per match from his Red Devils team-mates - having collected 78 passes from 442 minutes of football. Even though this is an increase on his previous numbers, the Danish forward still sits in the bottom-five strikers in regard to passes received per 90. Despite receiving the ball more often, there's little difference in which half of the pitch Hojlund collects the ball - which is understandable given he's a striker. The Dane has collected 40 passes in the opposition's half since Christmas (an average of 8.1 times per match). His average before the Xmas break was 8.2.  Despite the previous stats, the most important one to understand the change in Hojlund's goalscoring form is the one that analyses his passes received in the penalty area. Prior to Christmas, Hojlund received the ball just three times inside the penalty area - marking out an average of 0.3 times per match. However, in the last couple months, Hojlund now receives the ball inside the box 1.2 times per match - which has helped his upturn in form. His latest impressive performance came during United's 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon, where he opened the scoring with a fine finish.","His latest impressive performance came during United's 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon, where he opened the scoring with a fine finish."

436,Kylian Mbappe 'open to Arsenal transfer' as Thierry Henry influence comes to light,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kylian-Mbappe-open-to-Arsenal-transfer-as-Thierry-Henry-influence-comes-to-light/3301590,2 days ago,"Kylian Mbappe is open-minded to the possibility of joining Arsenal - because it would enable him to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Thierry Henry.  The France forward, 25, is once again the subject of intense transfer speculation after entering the final year of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, although it remains to be seen whether or not he will actually leave the Ligue 1 champions. Mbappe was courted relentlessly by Real Madrid back in 2022 before deciding against a move to the Bernabeu at the eleventh hour. Los Blancos are still in the frame for his signature, but it's been claimed in recent weeks that Mbappe is also open to other avenues of interest. While there have been previous links to the Premier League in the form of Liverpool, The Independent claim that Arsenal are an English club that Mbappe would 'willingly join', with the striker enticed by the opportunity of treading the same path as Henry. Henry became the Gunners' all-time leading goalscorer across two separate spells at the club and is widely regarded as one of Arsenal's greatest ever players. The forward turned television pundit is held in similar esteem by his home nation with only Olivier Giroud ahead of him in the French scoring charts. The report does establish that executives at PSG still expect Mbappe to join Real Madrid in the summer, but it's also noted that the financial package on offer from the Spanish giants is significantly lower than what the player himself expected. Liverpool were unwilling to break their wage structure when they were sounded out by Mbappe's camp last year and it's outlined that Arsenal would also take an identical stance on finances should a deal be broached. Although Mbappe is free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with clubs from overseas, he is yet to communicate whether or not he will take Real Madrid up on their latest offer. It's understood that the contract he has been offered equates to less than he was offered back in 2022 - a deal that the La Liga outfit believed they had wrapped up. Mbappe also turned down a lucrative proposal from Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal back in July after a world-record â¬300 million (Â£255.2m) bid for his services was tabled.",Mbappe also turned down a lucrative proposal from Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal back in July after a world-record â¬300 million (Â£255.2m) bid for his services was tabled.
437,âResentful and proudâ â Story behind PSGâs battle for Parc des Princes,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/%E2%80%98Resentful-and-proud%E2%80%99-%E2%80%93-Story-behind-PSG%E2%80%99s-battle-for-Parc-des-Princes/3301142,13 Feb,"The President of Paris Saint-Germain, Nasser al-KhelaÃ¯fi, confirmed that the deadlock for the sale of the Parc des Princes was over. PSG would leave their historic stadium after failing to convince the City of Paris and its mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to sell to the club.  al-KhelaÃ¯fi on the matter was clear, the battle was finished. âItâs easy to say now that the stadium is no longer for sale. We know what we want. We have wasted years trying to buy the Parc. Itâs over now. We want to move out of the Parc.â It was a statement that put an end to the years-long brinksmanship between al-KhelaÃ¯fi and Hidalgo as they waited for the other to blink first. For months it had been reported that neither side was in communication with the other despite the ongoing ânegotiationsâ for the stadium. Neither party was willing to make the first step and re-engage contact with the other, as neither the mayor nor president wanted to be seen as having given in to the other. In a report by LâÃquipe, a source close to the two central figures in the battle for the future of the Parc des Princes refers to them as similar, âthey are very resentful and proud, both of them.â This comes some way to explaining how we have arrived in the predicament that we find ourselves in where PSG threaten to leave their stadium, and the City of Paris will have a nearly 50,000-capacity stadium without a tenant. The relationship between Hidalgo and al-KhelaÃ¯fi had not always been bad, before their conflict the mayor was said to have referred to the president as âmy Nasser,â whilst the president would greet her with a kiss. Hidalgo could often be spotted visiting the stadium to support the team and was said by LâÃquipe to have helped celebrate the arrival of Neymar Jr. to the club in 2017 by agreeing to the presidentâs request to light the Eiffel Tower in yellow and green. Until the summer of 2022, the City of Paris and PSG held regular discussions over the clubâs aims to increase the capacity of the Parc from its current 47,000 to 57,000. And during these conversations, PSG were repeatedly clear that it would only proceed with these improvements on the condition that it became the owner of the stadium. It is thought that the city at the time was happy to engage in these conversations and was open to the process of selling the stadium to the club, even asking PSG to make an offer. However, communications began to fray over the initial evaluation proposed by the club. PSG offered just below â¬40 million for the Parc. An offer that was considered insultingly low by the City Council, with Hidalgo publicly criticising the opening offer as being âridiculous,â thereby beginning the process to which by this year further negotiations had completely deteriorated, as both sides became entrenched in their position.","PSG offered just below â¬40 million for the Parc.

438,Barcelona 'will listen to offers for Kounde this summer' to ease financial woes,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-will-listen-to-offers-for-Kounde-this-summer-to-ease-financial-woes/3301693,2 days ago,"Barcelona will listen to offers for defender Jules Kounde this summer as they continue to navigate their precarious financial situation, according to reports.  The LaLiga champions have made a poor fist at defending their crown and find themselves 10 points behind leaders Real Madrid, in third. Lacklustre displays this season have seen Xavi announce that he will depart at the end of the campaign, while Frenkie de Jong has been reported to be ready to join him out the door this summer. According to Mundo Deportivo, they are not the only ones as Kounde, who signed from Sevilla in 2022, could also be set to call time on his Barcelona career. The Catalan giants are well stocked in the centre-back position with the likes of Ronald Araujo, Inigo Martinez, Pau Cubarsi and Andreas Christensen at the club.  The outlet report that the French international has himself grown frustrated after predominantly being deployed by Xavi in his less-favoured position of right back. Despite assurances that he would return to the centre of defence with the arrival of Joao Cancelo last summer, Kounde has often found himself in the fullback role. The 25-year-old joined the club from Sevilla for a Â£46m as part of a remarkable summer recruitment drive, given the financial issues at the club. Kounde was joined by ex-Leeds winger Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski, Franck Kessie, Hector Bellerin, Marcos Alonso and Christensen. 18 months later, it's difficult to make a strong case for any of the additions being a success, despite Xavi leading the team to the LaLiga title last term. Kounde came close to signing for Chelsea before he decided on the move to Barcelona. In fact, the Blues were approaching a deal for the defender the previous year with there being a strong belief in Spain that the Frenchman moving to Stamford Bridge was inevitable once the Boehly-Clearlake takeover was completed.","Kounde came close to signing for Chelsea before he decided on the move to Barcelona.

William Saliba, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel and Leandro Trossard had all got on the scoresheet before half-time at the London Stadium, with supporters departing en masse during the interval. Saka then added a second after the restart before Rice completed the rout with an explosive finish from outside of the box to add insult to injury to the hapless Hammers. As he wheeled away the England international chose not to celebrate shortly after was replaced by Mohamed Elneny with the result well beyond doubt. Though he refrained from expressing his excitement on the pitch, Rice couldn't help but crack a smile on the bench as he talked Saka and Ben White through his goal.  After bolstering their title ambitions with such a decisive victory, Arsenal fans took to social media to share their reactions to the incident. One wrote: 'Declan Rice on the bench laughing at West Ham, they clapped him off.' Another added: 'Rice cracking up on the bench. I know their fans are seething.'

Though he chose not to celebrate his goal, Rice was not exempted from a hostile reception on his return to the home of his former club.

Gunners fan Piers Morgan commented on Rice's reception during the game, calling the West Ham fans that boo'd their former captain 'classless'.","Gunners fan Piers Morgan commented on Rice's reception during the game, calling the West Ham fans that boo'd their former captain 'classless'."
440,Real Madrid possible starting XI against RB Leipzig in the Champions League,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Madrid-possible-starting-XI-against-RB-Leipzig-in-the-Champions-League/3301116,13 Feb,"Ancelotti did not reveal who would replace Bellingham in Real Madridâs starting XI for their game in Germany.  Real Madrid return to their favourite competition: the Champions League. They do so on German soil, against RB Leipzig (KO 3pm ET / 12pm PT), one of the teams that beat them in the last edition of the continental competition. On paper, Ancelottiâs men should have no problems to emerge victorious in the two-legged tie; they will play the second leg on March 6 at the Santiago BernabÃ©u stadium. For this trip to Germany, Ancelotti has called up 23 players in a squad that includes four youth team members: defenders Carrillo and Jacobo (who were already called up last Saturday for the match against Girona) and midfielders Nico Paz and Mario MartÃ­n, who are alternating between Castilla and the first team. Nico Paz has already made his debut in the first team and managed to score a goal in the Champions League against Napoli at the BernabÃ©u. For the game against the Germans, Ancelotti has important absences in four areas of the pitch: Courtois, MilitÃ£o, Alaba, RÃ¼diger and Bellingham, who was the victim of a severe sprain that will keep him off the pitch for the next three weeks: replacing the Englishman is the main doubt that runs through the mind of the Italian coach. Who will be the Englishmanâs replacement in the next games? Carletto has several options for such a hole in his team. The most obvious option is that of Brahim. The midfielder from MÃ¡laga has always been the natural replacement for the Englishman until now, and has produced fantastic performances when given the chance. Brahim has 7 goals in 27 games, as well as 3 assists. It was quite a tough start to the season for the player, who barely had any minutes, but little by little he changed his position in the squad heirarchy. If Brahim plays, he will feature on the left, shifting to a 4-4-2 in defensive moments of the game. The other options for change appear in the middle of the field and in the attacking line. Luka Modric could feature into the centre of the pitch, appearing close to the opponentâs goal. Playing as a playmaker would be a throwback to his days at both Dinamo Zagreb and Tottenham too, as well as at Madrid under Zinedine Zidane, who at times opted to push the Croatian higher up the pitch. The second option for Ancelotti is that of Joselu as a poaching centre-forward: a player who would help to stretch the play and linking up with both Vinicius and Rodrygo when creating attacks, he has been doing well across the season. Furthermore, Ancelotti welcomes back Nacho, who will start as a pair with TchouamÃ©ni, who was impressive against Girona. With the Frenchman occupying the central position, Real Madrid are yet to concede. That will move Carvajal back to the right back slot, while Mendy will occupy the left side. In the middle of the pitch, Camavinga will be in the double pivot alongside Kroos, with Valverde occupying the right side. Up top, itâs as youâd expect, with the Brazilian duo set to play: Vinicius will reach 50 games in the Champions League, and Rodrygo, 200 games with Madrid in all competitions. Real Madridâs possible starting XI: Lunin; Carvajal, TchouamÃ©ni, Nacho, Mendy; Kroos, Camavinga, Valverde, Brahim; Vinicius & Rodrygo.","Real Madridâs possible starting XI: Lunin; Carvajal, TchouamÃ©ni, Nacho, Mendy; Kroos, Camavinga, Valverde, Brahim; Vinicius & Rodrygo."
441,Brentford sign Igor Thiago from Club Bruges for Â£31m with the Brazilian striker,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Brentford-sign-Igor-Thiago-from-Club-Bruges-for-%C2%A331m-with-the-Brazilian-striker/3301860,1 day ago,"Brentford have completed the signing of Igor Thiago from Club Bruges.  The 22-year-old striker will join on a five-year-deal, starting on 1 July. The club will also have the option to extend the contract by an additional 12 months. Reports in Belgium claim Brentford have paid â¬37million (Â£31m) for Thiago. The move comes amid doubts over the future of Ivan Toney, who is expected to leave in the summer with Chelsea and Arsenal interested. Thiago, who began his career in his native Brazil, joined Club Bruges in June from Bulgarian side Ludogorets.  He has scored 16 times and provided two assists in Belgium's top division this term. Brentford head coach Thomas Frank said: 'I'm very pleased that we have been proactive as a club; big credit to Matthew Benham, Phil Giles and Lee Dykes for the hard work they have done. We are ahead of the curve. 'We have signed a key player for a key position. Thiago is a very exciting striker who fits the role in our team. He is hard working and a very good pressing player. He is also a physical presence, very good in the box and can link the play. 'He's progressing well in the Belgian league, so there is big potential and we are looking forward to seeing him in a red and white shirt.' The 22-year-old began his professional career in his native Brazil with Cruzeiro. In March 2022, he made the move to Europe to sign for Bulgarian champions Ludogorets Razgrad. At Ludogorets, he netted 15 goals and provided eight assists in 32 league matches. He also made an impact in the Europa Conference League with two goals.  The Thiago deal seemingly paves the way for Toney's summer exit. Toney has only returned in January from an eight-month ban for breaching FA gambling rules, but is already linked with Arsenal and Chelsea. Frank has said the striker may stay beyond the end of the season but his long-term future lies away from the Gtech Community Stadium via 'a couple of scenarios.' He is out of contract at the end of next season and has stated his desire to play for a club higher up the Premier League.",He is out of contract at the end of next season and has stated his desire to play for a club higher up the Premier League.

He also accepted that he got things wrong at the Bernabeu, after Real Madrid thumped his side 4-0.  âThe criticism is good and I accept it. I am aware of my responsibility,â he told Esport3, as carried by Sport. âIf we donât lose against Athletic we will be in a very good position, but I think that more or less we have to score 73-75 points to enter the Champions League,â Michel noted. Girona are just 17 points off the high end of that total, with 14 games remaining. If they maintain their current rate, they will clear that mark with ease, but a defeat to Athletic would fuel talk of a drop off. Michelâs side were beaten by Real Madrid in the first clash between the two 3-0, but their loss was not as emphatic as at the Santiago Bernabeu, and he did admit he would have given a different team talk in hindsight. âIf I could, I would give another team talk. I told them that everyone would be focused on the game, that we were capable of playing one-on-one t the Bernabeuâ¦ I think I would give a different talk.â His stellar work has seen him linked to the Barcelona job in recent weeks, but that talk has died down of late. Perhaps because Michel is adamant he will continue an hour north of the Catalan capital. âI am a better coach thanks to this club. Quique Carcel [sporting director] and the club have made my work very happy, in other teams I have had more problems. I have a contract and I am very comfortable. I think I will continue here.

Barcelona have won five of their last six matches in La Liga, a run that they will hope to extend against a struggling Granada side. They produce an excellent result and performance last time out against Alaves, and as a result, head coach Xavi Hernandez intends to make just one change from that side. Itâs a big one too, as Sport say that Marc-Andre Ter Stegen will return in goals, having fully recovered from a back injury that has seen him out of action for the last three months. Inaki Pena, who has deputised during this period, will return to the bench. Raphinha is also back from injury, but he is expected to be a substitute, with Lamine Yamal in line to start his sixth successive match. Granada are winless in their last four, and they need to start picking up results if they are to remain in La Liga beyond this season. There will be no Bryan Zaragoza, who tormented Barcelona in the return fixture, as he joined Bayern Munich in January. There is expected to be two changes from the side that drew with Las Palmas last time out, with Kamil Piatkowski and Gonzalo Villar suspended â their replacements are likely to be Ignasi Miquel and Gerard Gumbau. Barcelona will fancy their chances of continuing their good form with another victory in this one. However, Granada â whom Xavi has yet to defeat during his time in charge â will make it very difficult, as they look for a positive result of their own.","Barcelona will fancy their chances of continuing their good form with another victory in this one.

Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring 10 minutes in with a slick first-time finish after Phil Foden fed him the ball in the box. However, Grealish had to come off for Jeremy Doku after challenging for the ball with Diogo Goncalves, falling down in pain after 20 minutes despite making no contact and thus sparking fears that it could be a muscle injury.

449,Milan 3-0 Rennes: Loftus-Cheek brace helps Rossoneri take control of play-off,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Milan-3-0-Rennes-Loftus-Cheek-brace-helps-Rossoneri-take-control-of-play-off/3302194,21 hours ago,"Ruben Loftus-Cheek scored twice as AC Milan took control of their Europa League play-off against Rennes with a 3-0 victory in the first leg at San Siro.  Stefano Pioliâs men finished third in their Champions League group, but continue to build momentum on the back of just one defeat in 13 games now through all competitions. Former Chelsea midfielder Loftus-Cheek put Milan in front in the 32nd minute with a glancing header and nodded home another at the start of the second half before Rafael Leao swiftly fired in a third, leaving the Italian giants within touching distance of a place in the last 16.  The Rossoneri almost took an early lead when Leaoâs close-range effort struck the crossbar before Theo Hernandez blazed over from the edge of the penalty area following a corner. Loftus-Cheek then burst down the right and cut the ball back to Yunus Musah, who sent his shot wide. After soaking up plenty of early pressure, Rennes went close in the 21st minute when captain Benjamin Bourigeaudâs long-range effort flew just off target.

The hosts â currently third in Serie A, a point behind Juventus â continued to press as Olivier Giroudâs low drive from the edge of the area was clawed away by Rennes goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. Rennes, who had been unbeaten in nine games, threatened on the counter when teenage winger Desire Doue drove forwards and drilled in a 20-yard effort, which was straight at Milan keeper Mike Maignan. The French side fell further behind just two minutes into the second half when Loftus-Cheek nodded in from close range after Mandanda had palmed out a flicked header at the near post from Milan defender Simon Kjaer. Loftus-Cheek #UEL pic.twitter.com/rPftaabLrA â UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) February 15, 2024 Before Rennes could look to regroup, Leao had fired in Milanâs third â his 50th goal for the club â after a neat exchange with Christian Pulisic down the right in the 53rd minute. Rennes made a couple of changes to try to sharpen up the team and had a good spell of pressure heading into the final 20 minutes, with a low 22-yard drive from substitute Amine Gouiri testing Maignan. Milan had a late chance to score a fourth when Pulisic broke down the left wing. The Americanâs shot was parried by Mandanda and then substitute Noah Okafor saw his follow-up hacked off the line by Rennes midfielder Azor Matusiwa. Maignan saved again from Gouiri before Ludovic Blas fired over as Rennes were left with it all to do in next weekâs second leg at Roazhon Park. 0' The match is about to start!  7' Match Event for Milan vs Rennes  8' Match Event for Milan vs Rennes  10' Highlight from Milan vs Rennes  22' Match Event for Milan vs Rennes  23' Match Event for Milan vs Rennes 31' GOAL!

Los Blancos were very poor in the first half, and they could have been behind inside the opening few minutes. Xavier Schlagerâs shot was turned home by Benjamin Sesko, although the goal appeared to be ruled out for an offside against Benjamin Henrichs, who was adjudged to have impeded Andriy Lunin. Lunin was in fine form on the night, as he made numerous saves to keep the hosts at bay. It was crucial that he did so too, as Real Madrid scored the only goal of the goal in the second half. Brahim Diaz did brilliantly to fashion a chance out of nothing, and he fired home from the edge of the box to make it 1-0.

452,McGinn was least surprised man at Villa Park to see McTominay score the winner,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/McGinn-was-least-surprised-man-at-Villa-Park-to-see-McTominay-score-the-winner/3301111,13 Feb,"There were at least two people in the 42,000 crowd inside Villa Park on Sunday that would not have been surprised to see Scott McTominay pop up with the winning goal.  John McGinn, his Scotland team-mate, has known for months now just what a goalscoring threat the Manchester United man is. He's not United's top scorer in the Premier League by accident. 'He is so athletic and he gets in the box and hits the ball harder than anyone I have ever played with,' Villa captain McGinn said of McTominay previously. 'It's no surprise he is getting goals. As long as he slows down just a wee bit!' There was no slowing down with his winner at Villa, a bullet header from Diogo Dalot's cross that takes his tally to seven in the Premier League this season. Single-handily he's contributed to 12 points won for United.   The other person unsurprised to see McTominay thriving is that of his manager Erik ten Hag, someone who was more than happy to send the Scot packing as recent as last summer. He's indispensable now. Funny how things turn. 'Nowadays players who are subs are moaning and complaining and of course Scott is disappointed,' Ten Hag said, 'but he's ready for every minute and we have to credit him for this mentality. He's an example for all the other players. I love it.'  Sources at United speak of McTominay's desire to prove himself every single day, even in the face of being recast as a super-sub since his last league start on December 23, then in a 2-0 defeat to West Ham. There is a fire inside the 27-year-old, a 'fiery' side by his own admission, that after more than a year of working together, Ten Hag now knows how to light on a routine basis for maximum results. Earlier in the season at Old Trafford, with United down 1-0 to Brentford, McTominay stood alongside Ten Hag on the touchline and the message was short and sweet: 'Go on and show yourself, show why you should be playing.' McTominay went ahead and scored a brace to win United the game and significantly ease the pressure on Ten Hag's job. Emerging through at United under Jose Mourinho, there has been a nagging sense that McTominay has long been miscast as a defensive midfielder when he operates better further forward. Scotland boss Steve Clarke was the first to make the change, pushing McTominay towards a more natural No 10 role, and Ten Hag was quick to follow suit, at least off the bench. The results have spoken for themselves.   After one conversation with Clarke late last year where his national team boss told him to 'think about football as you did as a child', something clicked in McTominay's mind. He went and scored four goals in the two games that followed that conversation. For now it's United reaping the rewards of his goalscoring touch - but that doesn't mean McTominay isn't still fuelled by a self-doubt that has plagued him since he spent two years as a teenager in United's academy without kicking a single ball. 'Whenever you're not playing, you can't take it too personally,' he told the High Performance Podcast last month. 'At points, I did. I thought 'whatever'.   'It's one of the most challenging times in your career. But when you aren't in the team you have to be aware of the group you're in - it's not always about me, me, me. You have to be conscious that every player wants to play every game and when you are given the opportunity to play you have to take it. 'It's self doubt, you always have to prove yourself or they will go and get someone that is better. You have to prove that hopefully they are not and you are the one who helps the team as much as possible moving forward. I genuinely feel like that, prove yourself in every training session.' No player has scored more goals off the bench than McTominay this season; no player has scored more goals for United in the Premier League than McTominay; and 30 per cent of United's total points this season can be accounted for by McTominay. McGinn's wish for his compatriot to slow down doesn't seem like coming true anytime soon.",McGinn's wish for his compatriot to slow down doesn't seem like coming true anytime soon.

Hayes announced her decision to step down in November and will become the head coach of the United States Womenâs national team at the end of the campaign. Her departure marks the end of a 12-year reign at Chelsea where she has won six Womenâs Super League titles, five FA Cups and two League Cups. James has worked with Hayes since her arrival at the club in 2021 aged 19 and she has since gone on to impress, recently earning the Barclays Player of the Month award in January after scoring five goals in two games.

Itâs football and people move on, Iâll just have to focus on Chelsea.â Jamesâ goalscoring feats last month helped Chelsea cement their spot at the summit of the WSL, where they sit three points clear of second-placed Manchester City ahead of a huge top-of-the-table clash on Friday night. The 22-year-old England forward scored a hat-trick in a 3-1 win against former club Manchester United before bagging a brace in the 3-0 victory against Brighton. Lauren James  James is aiming to continue her form throughout the rest of the season, which sees her in the running for the WSL Golden Boot after scoring 12 goals in as many league games. She said: âIt was a special feeling to receive (the Player of the Month award), I got five goals in two games, so it wasnât that bad of a month! Hopefully I can just continue that form throughout the season.â As well as striving for a fifth successive league title, Chelsea remain in the hunt for trophies in three other competitions in a jam-packed schedule next month. March 3 sees them take on Manchester City in the Continental Tyres League Cup before facing Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals three days later and they then play Ajax in the Champions League quarter-finals. The Champions League is arguably Chelseaâs more coveted prize and is the one major trophy missing from their impressive collection. They came close in 2021 after finishing as runners-up following a 4-0 defeat to Barcelona in the final and James admits getting far in the competition is the aim. âI think it would be amazing, itâs something that everyone wants and dreams of,â she said. âItâs something this club have been working towards for a while now. Hopefully on Emmaâs final year we can hopefully get that far. âI think (the Champions League) is good experience, the games have been a bit quicker because youâre playing against different opponents from different countries with different styles of play.â","âI think (the Champions League) is good experience, the games have been a bit quicker because youâre playing against different opponents from different countries with different styles of play.â"

It was announced by the Serie A club that Ramsey, then 28, had agreed a four-year deal and would officially join on July 1, the day after his Arsenal contract expired. Confirmation of the move ended considerable speculation over the future of the Wales international, who turned down a new deal at the Emirates Stadium. Juventus had long been the favourites for Ramseyâs signature despite a host of other top European clubs, including Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris St Germain and Bayern Munich, being linked. In a statement issued on his social media platforms, Ramsey wrote: âI wanted to issue a personal statement for all the Arsenal fans who have been extremely loyal and supportive. âYou welcomed me as a teenager and have been there for me through all the highs and lows I have encountered during my time at the club. âIt is with a heavy heart that I leave after 11 incredible years in north London. Thank you. âI will continue to give the team 100 per cent and hope to finish the season strongly, before heading on to my next chapter in Turin.â A statement from the Gunners read: âEveryone at Arsenal Football Club wishes Aaron Ramsey a happy and successful future. Aaron Ramsey  âAaronâs made a fantastic contribution to our club since joining from Cardiff City in 2008. He has always been a consummate professional and will always have a special place in the hearts and memories of Arsenal fans around the world.â Following his departure from Arsenal, Ramsey played 70 times for Juventus, winning the Serie A title once. He was loaned out to Rangers before joining Nice on a free transfer. Ramsey re-joined Cardiff last summer after his contract with Nice was terminated by mutual consent. Ramsey, now 33, scored three times in his opening six games for the Bluebirds, but has been sidelined since September with a knee injury.","Ramsey, now 33, scored three times in his opening six games for the Bluebirds, but has been sidelined since September with a knee injury."

But how do Mbappe and Haalandâs records compare in the worldâs most prestigious cup competition, the Champions League? Messi and Ronaldo are way out in front as the competitionâs two all-time top goalscorers, but Haaland and Mbappe have made such strong starts they can have genuine ambitions of one day eclipsing their tallies. Mbappe is yet to win the Champions League. He made it to the final in 2020 but couldnât find a way through as PSG suffered a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Lisbon final. Haaland is two years younger and burst onto the scene a few years later. Heâs only made half as many Champions League appearances as Mbappe but heâs quickly catching up on the Frenchmanâs goal tally after making a lightning-fast start with Red Bull Salzburg and Borussia Dortmund before lifting the trophy â as part of a historic treble â in his debut season with Manchester City. âThere are so many good players and Kylian is one of them.

457,German media label Kane's performance against Bayer Leverkusen a 'CATASTROPHE',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/German-media-label-Kanes-performance-against-Bayer-Leverkusen-a-CATASTROPHE/3299208,11 Feb,"The German press have torn into Harry Kane after Bayern Munich suffered a dreadful 3-0 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night.  Thomas Tuchel's side headed into the crunch clash with just two points separating them from their Bundesliga title rivals. However, Bayern endured a disastrous evening as they were hammered thanks to goals Josip Stanisic, Alejandro Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong. To add insult to injury, Stanisic is currently on loan at Leverkusen from Bayern. The result means Xabi Alonso's side - who remain unbeaten - are five points clear of Bayern with 13 games to go, and the German giants are now in danger of missing out on the Bundesliga title for the first time since 2011-12, having won it for 11 consecutive seasons. And, following the clash, several of Bayern's stars were slammed by the German media, including Kane.   German outlet BILD labelled his performance a 'catastrophe', while a headline to one article read: 'The Kane disaster'. It went on to add: 'He was actually brought in for games like this,' before it later said: 'Harry Kane and his worst game in a Bayern jersey.' In total, the England skipper took just 18 touches across the 90 minutes and had one shot as Bayern achieved an xG of 0.27 despite having 62 per cent of possession. Bild's report went onto criticise Kane further for his inefficiency against Leverkusen's defenders, while highlighting how Alonso's outfit deserved the victory, with Tuchel left bemoaning 'the lack of power at the front' of his team. It continued: 'Kane wasn't in the game at all. No goal, no assist â BILD grade 6! 'Only his effort was right: he ran 10.8 km, only Mazraoui ran more for Bayern. 'He should win the top scorer cannon. But he came to Bayern to win championships...' Kane's Â£100m move to Germany in the summer did indeed come with the aim of winning trophies as, despite being one of the best strikers of his generation, the 30-year-old is yet to lift any silverware in his career. But with their title challenge faltering, and Bayern out of the DFB Pokal and having failed to win the German Super Cup, this drought could continue, although Bayern remain in the Champions League. Despite the significant criticism Kane faced after the Leverkusen defeat, he has enjoyed a sensational season. The 30-year-old has 28 goals and eight assists in 28 appearances in all competitions and even with Saturday's blank, Kane has netted 24 times in 21 league games.    But, a dire display in their biggest game of the season so far has attracted significant outcry, with Bayern star Thomas Muller hitting out at his team-mates post-game, hinting that all is not well among the squad. Speaking to Sky Sports Germany, he fumed: 'There are of course some symptoms on the pitch. To be honest, I'm p***ed off. 'To quote Oliver Kahn: What I miss from us players are the b***s in the game. We are showing significantly better approaches in training. 'It's okay to feel pressure, but there needs to be energy and freedom. That's missing in our game.' He continued: 'Sometimes we have to speak about us players. It's not just about the coach. 'We have many international players at the highest level, we need to step up our game.' Thomas Tuchel refused to give up on the title race after the match and echoed Muller's words for improved application among his squad.   He added: 'We are not going to throw the towel on whatever matchday. For us the gap has changed, but the approach won't. 'We have to keep going, we have to get better and live up to the standards that Thomas (Muller) has also formulated.' Saturday's result came after the first league meeting between the title rivals ended in a 2-2 draw back in September and Kane did score on that occasion. Bayern return to action on Wednesday when they face Lazio in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, before they travel to Bochum in the Bundesliga next Sunday.","Bayern return to action on Wednesday when they face Lazio in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, before they travel to Bochum in the Bundesliga next Sunday."

Mauricio Pochettino's side beat the beleaguered Eagles in dramatic fashion at Selhurst Park after coming from behind to win 3-1, with Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez both scoring in added time at the end of the second half. Gallagher had earlier cancelled out Jefferson Lerma's stunning opener for the hosts and it means he now has three goals in two games after previously enduring a 34-game goal drought. Selhurst Park has become a happy hunting ground for the 24-year-old, with the midfielder scoring eight times during an impressive loan spell at Palace in 2021-22, before netting his first Chelsea goal there last season. And, speaking to Sky Sports post-match, Gallagher reflected on the victory before he was informed about how far he ran during the victory.  'When we scored early in the second half it was the thought we've got to go and win this now,' he said. 'It was getting later and later and my calves started to cramp up with a few minutes to go. 'So to get that goal and then Enzo to get that one at the end is an amazing feeling and the lads were buzzing.' Host Dave Jones then interjected and said: 'Well I have a reason why your calves may have been cramping up. You ran 13km tonight. I think that's the first time you've done that in the Premier League.' Gallagher amusingly replied: 'Wow, that's far, init! 'I always want to run as hard as I can for the team. It didn't feel like I ran that far today because we had so much of the ball, but yeah I'm happy.'   The victory - which was Chelsea's 13th in a row against Palace - took the Blues back into the top half and they are now just two points off the European places. It builds upon their 3-1 FA Cup victory at Aston Villa last Wednesday as they look to turn the corner after what seemed to be this season's nadir a week ago on Sunday when Pochettino's side lost 4-2 to Wolves at Stamford Bridge.

That builds towards a Champions League return, away at Inter Milan in a last 16 first leg, and key defender Jose Maria Gimenez will return in time.  The Uruguayan international has not been included in the squad travelling to Sevilla, as Simeone looks to manage his return, with Saul Niguez suspended. Simeone confirmed Gimenez will rejoin full training next week and could feature against Las Palmas as a preparation for facing Inter as per reports from Diario AS.

Kubo moved to La Real two summers ago from Real Madrid for a little under â¬6m, although Los Blancos have retained 50% of his sell-on fee. Since he has gone from strength to strength at the Reale Arena, playing a key role in their qualification for the Champions League last season, and their progress to the Round of 16 this year. He had been linked with a move away this summer, with a â¬60m release clause looking increasingly like value for money for Europeâs giants. A new deal though should give La Real some security over his future, or at least a better negotiating position, although his release clause in the new contract is so far unclear. Liverpool and Saudi Arabia had both enquired about his availability last month, and it was beginning to look like a tricky task for La Real to retain him in the summer, although Kubo had made it clear he would not be going anywhere in January. It may be that Real Sociedad are simply increasing the asking price, but Kubo has spoken of how happy he is in Donostia-San Sebastian on numerous occasions.","Liverpool and Saudi Arabia had both enquired about his availability last month, and it was beginning to look like a tricky task for La Real to retain him in the summer, although Kubo had made it clear he would not be going anywhere in January.

462,Every PL goalkeeper ranked on how many xG they've prevented: Vicario tops,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Every-PL-goalkeeper-ranked-on-how-many-xG-theyve-prevented-Vicario-tops/3302071,1 day ago,"Expected goals, or xG, have become one of the biggest buzzwords in the world of the Premier League - but some goalkeepers do better at preventing them than others.  While Liverpool might be two points clear at the top of the Premier League table with 14 games left for them to play, Alisson is not at the top of the table for xG saved, according to the data. And whilst Everton, Burnley and Sheffield United make up the relegation places, it is a team higher up the table who have the goalkeeper who has made the fewest saves when compared to the xG they have faced between the sticks. GiveMeSport and FBREF have come together to share the data on the goalkeepers who have performed best against the opportunities they have faced - and those who have fallen short of the mark. The table is topped by Tottenham Hotspur's Guglielmo Vicario, who has a score of +6.6, once the number of goals allowed is removed from the xG they have faced.  Vicario was in a precarious position at the start of the season, as he was brought in to replace Spurs stalwart and club captain Hugo Lloris in goal. But under Ange Postecoglou, he has become one of the key figures at Spurs, with the side currently sitting in fourth spot, and he has made a huge difference, by denying over six goals compared to the shots coming his way during league games. The figures only apply to those goalkeepers who have played six or more league games this season, so most clubs only have one player on the list. While Liverpool are top of the table on points, Reds shot-stopper Alisson is down in ninth place, with a score of +0.9 - although Manchester City's Ederson is in 17th spot, having conceded two more goals than he ought to have done when compared to the xG figure. However, Newcastle United have two in the top ten with Martin Dubravka on +2.2 and Nick Pope on +1.1 for the Magpies. Everton's Jordan Pickford has allowed exactly the same number of goals as the xG he has faced during his time in goal for the Toffees across the league campaign so far. At the other end of the table, both Brighton goalkeepers have struggled, with Bart Verbruggen on a score of -2.1, slightly ahead of his teammate Jason Steele on -2.4. Crystal Palace duo Dean Henderson and Sam Johnstone are also in the lower region of the table, as the Eagles struggle on the field under Roy Hodgson. But at the bottom of the table is Brentford's goalkeeper Mark Flekken, with a score of -6.4.   Thomas Frank's Bees had surpassed expectations in recent seasons, but Flekken has struggled to fill the hole left by the departure of David Raya to Arsenal. While Brentford's problems are not entirely the goalkeeper's fault, Flekken has conceded 6.4 more goals than he should have, ranking him as the worst Premier League goalkeeper among those with at least six appearances in the competition so far this season. There is still significant time for these goalkeepers to improve their scores before the end of the Premier League season in May - but they may also find themselves under pressure as forward-thinking teams try to get their sides going with a winning formula.",There is still significant time for these goalkeepers to improve their scores before the end of the Premier League season in May - but they may also find themselves under pressure as forward-thinking teams try to get their sides going with a winning formula.
463,âThe next Endrickâ? Everything you need to know about Man Utd target Thalys,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/%E2%80%98The-next-Endrick%E2%80%99-Everything-you-need-to-know-about-Man-Utd-target-Thalys/3300256,12 Feb,"South America is teeming with young talents right now and Manchester United have their eye on an upcoming Brazilian wonderkid.  The player in question is Thalys, a teenager currently playing for Brazilian outfit Palmeiras. He is already held in high regard in his native country and has even been dubbed as âthe next Endrickâ. According to Calciomercato, United are among the clubs who are interested in signing the teenager. Weâve taken a closer look at the Brazilian youngster and have gathered everything you need to know. Born in Sao Miguel dos Campos, Thalys is a Brazilian prospect who is currently on the books at Palmeiras. While the youngster is still yet to make his senior debut for the club, he has garnered a huge reputation for himself in youth football. He currently plays for the Palmeiras U20s and is highly thought of in his native country. Funnily enough, despite being dubbed as âthe next Endrickâ he is actually one year older than his Brazilian counterpart. Along with drawing comparisons to Endrick, the dynamic forward has also been compared to Rivaldo due to his similar play style. Much like Endrick, he is versatile enough to play in a number of positions. In his early days at Palmeiras, Thalys was a midfielder, although he has since been pushed higher up the pitch due to his striking power. The 18-year-old now predominately plays as a centre-forward although he can also operate as a second striker or right winger. He is naturally left-footed, although he is capable of finishing off either foot. Standing at 1.84m, he is taller than Endrick and therefore would be a greater aerial threat in and around the box. According to Calciomercato, Palmeiras are looking for âno less thanâ Â£34million for their latest prodigy. For context, Real Madrid paid a total package of around Â£60million to land Endrick from Palmeiras. In regards to Thalys, he is under contract until 2026 meaning that the Brazilian club is in a strong position to dictate his market value. Unsurprisingly, United arenât the only club who are interested. It was confirmed by AS that Palmeiras rejected an offer from Italy last January and plenty of top European sides are now sniffing around. As confirmed by Calciomercato, the likes of Juventus, Chelsea, Manchester City, Barcelona and PSG are also keeping tabs on the 18-year-old. âI believe that jumping to the Premier League immediately would be hasty,â Brazilian journalist Rogerio Amaral Junior told United in Focus. âHe doesnât have any games as a professional for Palmeiras. Heâs not an extra-class, like Endrick, but heâs a great player who has a lot of room for improvement. I think if he went now, he would have to be loaned to a smaller team to gain experience. âIn the youth categories, he is a striker who tends to be very regular but has never been tested under the pressure that is professional football. âAt Palmeiras, he also trains with the professional team but has not yet made his debut. It is likely that if he is not sold, he will make his professional debut this year.â","âAt Palmeiras, he also trains with the professional team but has not yet made his debut.

Sundayâs clash between fifth and sixth at Villa Park began with Rasmus Hojlund â the winner when these sides met on Boxing Day â scoring in his fifth straight Premier League match. United lost their way after that 17th-minute opener in a bright start and Villa eventually secured a deserved second-half leveller through Douglas Luiz. Aston Villa v Manchester United â Premier League â Villa Park  But the Red Devils dug deep and McTominay made it 2-1 in the 86th minute after meeting Diogo Dalotâs cross with a powerful header â his fourth Premier League goal this season from the bench. âThis season, last season as well (McTominay made an impact), so I think heâs an example for many other players nowadays,â Ten Hag said of a player whose overall top-flight goal tally this term is seven this term. âThere are not many players who can come from the bench and bring this energy. Heâs ready for every minute, always contributing to the team. Football is a team sport and we forget that often. âBut Scott is the example, always giving the spirit, in the week when he is training, doing the right things, working on himself, gives max. He understood the assignment #MUFC || #AVLMUN pic.twitter.com/uPiqOIrHrf â Manchester United (@ManUtd) February 11, 2024 âHeâs ready for one minute, heâs ready for 90 minutes, heâs always ready. I think itâs great to have such a player.â United rode their luck for large parts and Ten Hag appeared to indicate that Luizâs shimmy goalscoring celebration fuelled his side in a win that breathes new life into their Champions League hunt. The Red Devils are now five points behind Villa in fifth, and six adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham. âI think we can beat any opponent away or home,â the Dutchman said after winning a first Premier League away game to a top-eight side since taking charge. âBut sometimes away we have to believe it more because then we could have won in Arsenal, where actually we deserved to win. âWe could have won in Liverpool and itâs about belief and I think this team today believed they could win this game and thatâs why I think, in the end, you win the game.â Asked about the impact of this result on the race for Champions League football, Ten Hag said: âWe have to catch up. âWe are firstly in February, many games to play, but we are returning. But, still, a long way to go and we have to improve our game. Aston Villa v Manchester United â Premier League â Villa Park  âBut, of course, we are pleased that we get a series of wins.â This was the first time this season that United have managed to win four consecutive matches in all competitions, while the remain unbeaten in 2024. As for Villa, boss Unai Emery felt hard done by after his side slipped to a third straight home defeat in league and cup. âI want to tell you I am very proud of our work,â the Spaniard said. âIâm very proud as everything we planned before we more or less were doing on the pitch. Unai Emery: ""We have to accept, we have to understand how we can be stronger and try to get the right way for the next matches."" â Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) February 11, 2024 âWe were focused on a very good opportunity to make a big gap to them, but of course no win (for us). âWe know how difficult this match was. Manchester United in the moment  they are now and the last matches they won being confident. âBut we had control of the game, we created more chances than them, we deserved it more than them, we conceded less chances than them. âThey were clinical today, their goalkeeper was fantastic and we werenât clinical. Aston Villa v Manchester United â Premier League â Villa Park  âWe played, maybe along with the match against Manchester City here, the best match here this season. âEven from when we arrived here today, I think it was one of the best matches weâve played but the result was not good and we have to accept it.â","âEven from when we arrived here today, I think it was one of the best matches weâve played but the result was not good and we have to accept it.â"

Mahrez left Manchester City to join Saudi club Al-Ahli last summer, where he has linked up with the likes of ex-Liverpool star Roberto Firmino, former Newcastle winger Allan Saint-Maximin and ex-Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Footage of Mahrez breaking the news to his wife that he was joining Al-Ahli went viral on social media, with Ward explaining in the docuseries: ""Riyad rung me and basically told me that 'we're moving to Saudi'."" The clip then cuts to Ward sat across from Mahrez as she tells him: ""I'm going to be sat at home on my own."" To which Mahrez simply replies: ""It's part of the game innit."" And when asked about that moment in an interview with the Daily Mail, Ward admitted: ""That line haunts me. I keep seeing it on social media. That whole week was just an emotional rollercoaster really. ""It was a huge shock and I had absolutely no idea. One day we were planning for Riyad to go back to pre-season with City and then overnight we were moving to Saudi and I was planning this whole move. ""I think it was just very overwhelming at the time and a massive shock because I just didn't see it coming at all."" However, Ward admits she has been ""surprised"" by the move to Saudi Arabia, although she is missing being able to see her family and friends. ""The vibe is just very different,"" she explained. ""It's a lot more chilled out there, it's quieter and calmer, whereas in Manchester life is so busy - there's so much going on and we're always going out for dinner and seeing friends.

He continued: âAfter the restart, we tried to use greater mobility to create that numerical superiority we needed to cause Roma problems. âThe input we gave them was to find the positions of the midfielders and make the most of the wing-backs.

469,Emmanuel Petit Exclusive: Barcelonaâs two best managerial candidates are Spanish â but unlikely to join,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Emmanuel-Petit-Exclusive-Barcelona%E2%80%99s-two-best-managerial-candidates-are-Spanish-%E2%80%93-but-unlikely-to-join/3302588,19 hours ago,"Ever since Xavi Hernandez announced that he would be stepping down as Barcelona head coach at the end of the season, attention has turned to who his possible successor could be. So many names have already been linked, although Sporting Director Deco is currently in no rush to finalise an appointment.  Reports suggest that a more experienced coach is wanted, someone that is able to handle the pressure of managing one of the biggest clubs in world football, and one that generates plenty of scrutiny from fans and the media alike. With this in mind, a few key candidates have emerged. Hansi Flick looks to be the leading candidate at this moment, and he has edged slightly closer to the role in recent days. Equally, the likes of Thomas Tuchel and Jurgen Klopp have also been touted, although they are not as well placed. Former Barcelona midfielder Emmanuel Petit has spoken exclusively to Football EspaÃ±a to give his thoughts on who should be the successor to Xavi. âThere are some big name managers on the market at the moment. You have Flick, Mourinho, Conte, Klopp. I would say that Klopp is definitely the best solution for Barcelona, but heâs taking a sabbatical. Heâll take months to recharge â I love Klopp, heâs always honest and he gets straight to the point.â While Petit listed several high profile and experienced managers, he actually believes that Barcelona should look to appoint a younger coach, someone that can look to build a project. He outlined two key candidates, although he (biasedly) prefers one more than the other. âSince it wonât be Klopp, for me there are only two options. One of them is forbidden (to me), and thatâs Arteta â he has to stay at Arsenal. I think his story there is no ending yet, he has so much more to prove and improve. He didnât reach the top of this beautiful team yet, even if he wins the Premier League this season, it would be too soon for him to leave. I think he can manage to go further up with this team. âThe other one, for me, is the best solution, and thatâs Xabi Alonso. His work in Germany is amazing, itâs surprised me a lot how quick he has become successful as a manager, especially when you are at a country where you donât know much, you donât speak the language. I think itâs remarkable what heâs been doing with Leverkusen. If I was Barcelona, I would try everything to bring him. He has a proper identity in the game; a proper vision of what he wants his players to do; heâs Spanish. I think that would be the best solution for Barcelona.â There are multiple problems with hiring either Arteta or Alonso. Firstly, the big one is that it is highly unlikely that either would want to take charge of Barcelona from this summer. Arteta looks well settled at Arsenal, while Alonso is a devoted Madridista, so is not expected to be overly interested in a move to the Blaugrana â besides, heâs much more likely to join Liverpool if he does leave Leverkusen. The second is that neither fits the bill of an âexperiencedâ manager, which is the profile that Barcelona has set out. Granted, both are more qualified than Xavi was when he was appointed in 2021, but they could both still wilt under the pressure of managing a much bigger club than the one they are at now. However, thatâs not to say that either would be a bad appointment â in fact, both would probably be excellent decisions by Barcelona, but the main problem is that it doesnât look likely to happen.

Thuram flicked home from a Matteo Darmian cross four minutes after the break then pressured Roma defender Angelino into turning a ball from the left into his own net six minutes later. Roma pressed desperately for an equaliser, but Inter made sure of the points deep into stoppage time when defender Alessandro Bastoni finished off a swift counter-attack.

Seeking another win that would send them up to fourth, Roma started with confidence, and Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer had to tip over a shot from Stephan El Shaarawy inside the opening minute. Matias Pellegrini also came close from distance, but Inter grew into the game and grabbed the lead in the 18th minute when Federico Dimarcoâs corner was headed home by Francesco Acerbi. Italy Soccer Serie A  But Roma were level within 10 minutes when Gianluca Mancini nodded home from a free-kick, with set-plays proving dangerous for both sides in the slippery conditions. An end-to-end clash saw chances for Dimarco and Paulo Dybala at both ends before the hosts stunned Inter by grabbing the lead moments before the half-time break. Pellegrini led a sweeping counter-attack that sent the ball out to El Shaarawy on the left flank and his rising shot clattered against both posts before nestling in the net to put Roma 2-1 up. Inter responded strongly at the start of the second half and it took them only four minutes to level when Thuram met Darmianâs cross with the neatest of finishes. Italy Soccer Serie A  Angelino was unfortunate to divert the next past his own keeper after 56 minutes and Inter were intent on pressing home their advantage with Benjamin Pavard striking the post with a fine shot moments later. Romaâs best chance to give an engrossing game one final twist came in the 71st minute when former Inter man Romelu Lukaku was played clean through, but had the ball picked off his feet by the alert Sommer. It sparked a grandstand finish from the home side with Sommer having to be on his toes again to tip away an effort from Leonardo Spinazzola with six minutes left on the clock. But Romaâs increasing desperation left holes at the back and the visitors confirmed victory after a thrilling game through the unlikely figure of Bastoni. 0' The match is about to start!   2' El Shaarawy's shot saved by goalkeeper   13' Foul from Pavard Roma 0-0 Inter   20' GOAL!

Romario made 70 appearances for Brazil between 1987 and 2005, and scored 55 goals for his country. He won the Golden Ball award as Brazil lifted the World Cup in 1994. The former Barcelona player added that he feels that he was at the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Romario also stated his belief that he was a superior player to Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Luis Suarez. In an interview with Catenaccio e Contropiede, Romario was asked to compare himself with various star names, past and present.  According to Romario, only Diego Maradona and Pele were better than him. Romario was then asked to clarify if he felt that only two players were better than him. He nodded and then said: 'My opinion is this'. As well as Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, Romario expressed his belief that Brazil legends Ronaldinho and Ronaldo were also at the same level as he was. Romario stated that he was a better player than Rivaldo, Neymar, Adriano, Bebeto and Zico. During his time at Barcelona, Romario won the LaLiga title in the 1993-94 campaign. He also won three league titles and two Dutch Cups when he was at PSV. ",
472,Guardiola fires bold Champions League warning that Man City's rivals will hate,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Guardiola-fires-bold-Champions-League-warning-that-Man-Citys-rivals-will-hate/3301126,13 Feb,"Pep Guardiola has warned Europe that Manchester City believe they will retain the Champions League.  City go into the last 16 as huge favourites to overcome Danish underdogs FC Copenhagen and go on to lift the trophy they won for the first time in Istanbul last June. Guardiola admitted that when he arrived at the Etihad in 2016, he took over a club that wasnât convinced it was good enough to compete at the highest level. But the Bluesâ boss reckons last seasonâs historic Treble was the breakthrough moment that has given his team the confidence to show that they are in a class of their own. Guardiola said: âWhen I arrived eight years ago, I had the feeling that maybe this competition was too much for us. Our defeats and bad moments helped us to grow up and be in the position we are - two finals and one semi-final in the last three years - and the whole club has awareness that we can now try to be ourselves. âBefore it was âare you sure Pep, are we ready to do it?â Now the whole organisation believes we can do it. This is the best legacy that we give to the club and to the team that Manchester City can compete. That is so good. âWhen we lost the final to Chelsea two years ago, we lost one game in the whole competition - and it was in the final. After that, when we lost in the semi-final against Real [Madrid], we always competed. Now we have won all our group games. âMaybe tomorrow we don't play a good game and we don't behave well - but I don't think it will be different to the last three or four years. We challenge ourselves and we challenge the opponents who want to beat us. We feel it more than ever in the Premier League and the Champions League - and we want to do it again.ââ Guardiola has tried to defuse talk of City completing another Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup Treble. But City are well placed in all three competitions - and their manager reckons the pain of previous devastating European defeats is driving them on to even greater heights. He said: âI haven't seen mental problems with the team, otherwise we wouldn't be where we are. I said in summer it would be interesting to see how we react to the Treble, if we would be lazy. But I didn't have that feeling. âWe dropped points and lost games but the behaviour in training and how the players listened to me made me think that maybe this is the season when we come back from losing positions. âWe were not good at doing that before. When we conceded goals it was the end of the world in many games. We have good characters and personalities in the team with how they react in the bad moments. But the City boss is taking nothing for granted against the team that slayed Manchester United to emerge from a group that also included Bayern Munich and Galatasaray. It will be 63 days since Copenhagenâs last competitive break before Denmarkâs winter break saw them beat Galatasaray to reach the knock-out stages. And Guardiola warned: âThey will be starving to compete, be hungry and have full energy, fresh legs and mind. I don't know about their rhythm, but they have had lots of time to prepare for the game.â","It will be 63 days since Copenhagenâs last competitive break before Denmarkâs winter break saw them beat Galatasaray to reach the knock-out stages.

Hours before the start of Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium - home of the Raiders - Richards and Henry - two ex-Premier League stars - as well as Watt - an ex-defensive end and NFL three time Defensive Player of the Year - and Burleson - a former wide receiver-turned-broadcaster - took turns in answering a mix of soccer and football-related questions, asked by CBS Sports presenter Kate Abdo. When asked who's the 'goatier GOAT' between Messi - a World Cup and four-time Champions League winner - and Brady - a seven-time Super Bowl champ' - Richards said without hesitation: 'Messi. You gotta go with Messi.' 'Why? That could already be a statement,' replied Burleson, who once played on the Lions, Browns, Seahawks and Vikings. 'I mean we always talk about Mahomes already [catching up to] Brady,' said Richards - a former Manchester City and Aston Villa right-back.   'How many Super Bowls does he have?' Watt quipped about Messi before Richards told him that didn't matter, hitting back: 'How many Champions League does he have?' referring to Brady. All four former pros then shared a laugh before Burleson revealed that Brady is his GOAT over Messi, singling out the former Patriots and Bucs' quarterback as the reason why he didn't win a Super Bowl. 'I'm gonna say Tom Brady. Obviously I'm biased, because we've been watching him' said Burleson - a member of the Seahawks' 35th Anniversary team. 'Brady's the reason why we don't have any Super Bowls. He was dominant during his era over the twenty years that he played.'  'I do have to say that Lionel Messi is Lionel Messi...what an unbelievable talent,' Watt said straight afterwards as he then reminded everyone of his status as co-owner of Burnley. 'I do play a little bit of both sides of the fence now with the Burnley connection... I'll give it to Messi.' 'I played with the big man. Sorry,' Henry proceed to say unapologetically. 'I'm going with Lionel.' A few questions later, the four men were gathered to kick soccer balls and footballs into the fountains of the Bellagio - a five-star hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip - with Richards hitting a drone after punting a pigskin, much to the amusement of his on-air colleagues.","A few questions later, the four men were gathered to kick soccer balls and footballs into the fountains of the Bellagio - a five-star hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip - with Richards hitting a drone after punting a pigskin, much to the amusement of his on-air colleagues."

While Bukayo Saka was named man of the match and former Hammer Declan Rice earned plenty of plaudits on his goalscoring return to London Stadium, their captain became the first Premier League player since records began 20 years ago to complete more than 100 passes (107), create at least five chances (seven) and assist multiple goals (two) in the same game. The Norway international set up Leandro Trossard on the stroke of half-time to make it 4-0 to the Gunners before he teed up Saka for their fifth. Arsenal finished the game with more than 70 percent possession and recorded 25 attempts. It was their biggest away win in the Premier League and an all-time joint recording margin away from home. Beyond the numbers, the result moved Mikel Arteta's team to within two points of league leaders Liverpool. Speaking to club media afterwards, Odegaard said: ""It was a really good game and strong performance. I think coming from a big game, a big win, and to come here and back it up with this performance is a brilliant sign. ""During the game as well, we just wanted it more and more and I really liked the performance and the mentality of the team. ""We always want to improve, we always want more. I think we showed that today during the game as well. When you go three or four nil up, it's easy to drop a little bit, but we just kept on going and wanted more. That's why I really liked today."" Arsenal travel to Burnley on Saturday as they aim to keep the pressure on having won every game since their mid-season break. And Odegaard added: ""I'm happy to contribute to scoring goals and to winning games. And I think when we play like we did today, I think it's easier for everyone to shine as well. That's what we saw today, everyone enjoying their football and playing well together, and then it's easier for everyone. ""It's been a joy since I was handed the armband and I enjoyed every moment. I've said it many times, I love this team and I love what we're doing. We're going to keep pushing, keep improving and hopefully we can improve all the time. ""The last game at home was an incredible atmosphere - maybe the best I've seen in my life, to be honest. The supporters have given us so much the whole season last year they've been there, and we want to keep giving them something back. Today was another good way to do that.""","""The last game at home was an incredible atmosphere - maybe the best I've seen in my life, to be honest.

United have endured a difficult season so far, failing to progress in the Champions League and being knocked out early in the Carabao Cup. However, Erik ten Hag's men have improved in recent weeks. A five-match unbeaten run has seen them move up to sixth in the Premier League ahead of Sunday's clash with Aston Villa. And Shaw says the dressing room are determined to really kick on in the second half of the season. ""It's one of the biggest clubs in the world, if not the biggest,"" he said, in a chat with Sky Sports' YouTube channel. ""It's obviously a real honour to be here for so long and it's kind of my home now because I've been here so long. ""Of course, there's been a lot lot of ups and downs but, you know, I'm incredibly happy of the times I've had here, the good times. For me, I'm very ambitious, and there's a lot more that I want to achieve here. ""The most important thing is to focus on what's ahead. Every manager [I've worked with at United] has been different, they have their different tactics and ways of doing things, so it has changed over my time here and players come and go as well. I've been in a team with a lot of different players. ""We have a really good group here and a good manager, so we need to focus on what our ambitions are and what we want to achieve, which is winning the FA Cup and qualifying for the Champions League. ""Obviously, at the start of the season, that wasn't our ambition, we wanted to win everything, but at this point right now, we've got to be realistic about where we're at. For us now, a club like this must be in the Champions League and we're still in the FA Cup. These two should be our aim. We lost in the final of the FA Cup last season and that's even more inspiration."" Talking about Ten Hag, Shaw said: ""He's a really, really good manager. He's helped me a lot in the time he's been there and I think it's tough because we haven't had the season we all expected but I still think he's a great manager."" ""He's very good for this club and I believe he can take us to another level, but it's about consistency from us players on the pitch, delivering what he wants."" ""The manager is going to receive the most pressure from bad results, but sometimes as players we need to look at ourselves. He can only do so much with the game plan and getting us motivated."" ""We're the ones on the pitch and we need to deliver a good performance and win.

Mail Sport understands contingency plans are being drawn up in the event De Zerbi should leave. It is believed the 44-year-old is prominent in Liverpoolâs thinking as they seek a successor to Jurgen Klopp, who will depart at the end of the campaign. Former Reds midfielder Xabi Alonso, who has guided Bayer Leverkusen to the top of the Bundesliga in Germany, is another strong candidate. De Zerbi is also thought to have admirers among the INEOS group who now control the football operation at Manchester United, where Dan Ashworth is expected to accept a key role when his exit from Newcastle can be agreed. De Zerbiâs daring style of football has won admirers across Europe though his results at Brighton this season have been mixed, with only four wins from the Seagullsâ last 18 Premier League games, though they have progressed to the last 16 of the Europa League during that time.  The former Shakhtar Donetsk boss is thought to have had frustrations at a relative lack of control over transfer business, even though he claimed last December that he was open to signing a new contract with Brighton. âWe are speaking about the new contract but at the moment we are only speaking,â De Zerbi said. âAt the end we have to analyse the target. If the targets are the same as the club's, it's an honour for me working in Brighton. I don't try to reach the higher level.

478,Henry reveals his theory behind Klopp's shock Liverpool departure,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Henry-reveals-his-theory-behind-Klopps-shock-Liverpool-departure/3301367,14 Feb,"Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has revealed his theory as to why Jurgen Klopp decided to leave Liverpool.  Klopp shocked football with his announcement on January 26 that he will be stepping down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season. Since taking charge of Liverpool in 2015, Klopp has won the Premier League, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the League Cup. However, the 56-year-old feels that the conclusion of the current campaign is the right time for him to depart Anfield. Henry believes that Klopp has made the right decision in choosing to leave Liverpool.  Henry believes that the pressure and workload at Liverpool is one of the key reasons why Klopp is departing. Speaking on CBS Sports, Henry said: 'Pep was at Barcelona, took a sabbatical year. Klopp is at Liverpool, is stopping. Xavi is at Barcelona, he is also stopping. Three great clubs. 'That's a dream job normally and they are stopping. That tells you a story. The pressure, everybody has a voice, social media and whatnot. It is tough to be a manager and no one cares about you. You're going to have to take care of yourself at one point. 'I understand that it's very nice for fans and everybody involved, journalists, but do not think only about yourself and thinking that the Premier League will miss Klopp, that Liverpool will miss Klopp. We know that, we know that is true. 'But he was missing his family, he was missing his own time, he was missing his sanity. So good for him. When I got the news, I was like: 'Good for you.' Explaining his decision to stand down, Klopp stated that he was 'running out of energy'. He said: 'It is that I am, how can I say it, running out of energy. I have no problem now, obviously, I knew it already for longer that I will have to announce it at one point, but I am absolutely fine now. I know that I cannot do the job again and again and again and again. Klopp will be looking to secure further silverware before leaving Liverpool.  The Reds are currently top of the Premier League, two points ahead of Manchester City and Arsenal, although City have a game in hand. Liverpool will take on Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final later this month and have progressed to the round of 16 in the Europa League. In addition, Liverpool are through to the fifth round of the FA Cup, where they will host Southampton.","In addition, Liverpool are through to the fifth round of the FA Cup, where they will host Southampton."
479,Argentina could have Di Maria AND Messi in contention for their Olympic team,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Argentina-could-have-Di-Maria-AND-Messi-in-contention-for-their-Olympic-team/3301388,2 days ago,"After Argentina U23s secured their place at next summer's Olympics football tournament, coach Javier Mascherano revealed that legends Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria could be part of his squad.  Messi, 36, and Di Maria, 35, may be in the latter stages of their careers, but their vast amount of experience could prove to be very useful in helping a talented young Argentina side in their quest for glory. Speaking about the possibility of selecting his former Barcelona team-mate Messi, Mascherano said: 'Everyone already knows my relationship with Leo [Messi], the friendship I have. 'A player like him has the doors open to accompany us [at the Olympics], then it will obviously depend on him and his commitments.' The tournament will take place in France from July 24 to August 10, with nations permitted to include a maximum of three overage players in their squad. The core of the squad will be selected from players born on or after January 1, 2001.  Here's a look at how Argentina could line up at the tournament. Goalkeeper - Leandro Brey (Boca Juniors) 21-year-old Brey featured in every game as Argentina finished in second place in the Pre-Olympic tournament and made it through to the finals. Brey has made one senior appearance for Boca Juniors since joining from Los Andes in 2022.  Right-back - Gonzalo Lujan (San Lorenzo) Lujan has also been heavily involved for the Under-23s and also possesses a considerable amount of senior experience. The 22-year-old defender has made 61 appearances for Argentina first division side San Lorenzo.  Centre-back - Marco Di Cesare (Racing Club) A defender who was previously at Argentinos Juniors, Di Cesare signed for Racing Club in the January transfer window. The 22-year-old, who is also eligible to represent Italy, is capable of playing in midfield if required.  Centre-back - German Pezzella (Real Betis) If Messi and Di Maria are involved then they will take up two of the overage player spots available to Argentina. It remains to be seen who else could be called upon, but 32-year-old German Pezzella may be an option, especially as he isn't a regular starter for the senior team, meaning he might not play a key part at the Copa America.  Left-back - Valentin Barco (Brighton) A left-back with huge potential, Barco recently signed for Brighton from Boca Juniors. The 19-year-old featured for Argentina at various youth levels and could be an important part of the squad at the Olympics.  Midfield - Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea) Although he is an important figure for Argentina's senior team, Chelsea midfielder Fernandez could still be involved at the Olympics as he is just about eligible to feature. Fernandez was integral to Argentina's World Cup success and will also be eager for glory at the Olympics if he plays.  Midfield - Maximo Perrone (Manchester City, on loan at Las Palmas) Perrone joined Manchester City in January 2023 but has made just two appearances for the club so far. He is currently on loan at Las Palmas and has previously featured for Argentina at U20 level.  Midfield - Thiago Almada (Atlanta United) Part of Argentina's squad at the World Cup, 22-year-old Almada is an excellent creative talent. Also capable of playing out wide, the Atlanta United star regularly captained Argentina U23s during the Pre-Olympic tournament and is capable of finding the net with regularity.  Right wing - Angel Di Maria (Benfica) Having enjoyed a trophy-laden career, Di Maria has over 130 senior caps for Argentina and has impressed back at Benfica. He was the hero in Argentina's 2008 Olympic success as he scored the winner against Nigeria.  Undoubtedly one of the greatest players of all time, Messi is Argentina's record scorer with 106 goals. Messi helped Argentina to win the Olympic tournament in 2008 and it would be a brilliant story if he was to repeat the feat in 2024.  Left wing - Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United) Garnacho has continued to progress superbly at United, for whom he scored seven times this season. Having previously represented Spain at U18 level, he switched allegiance to Argentina and has three senior caps. It would certainly be intriguing to see Argentina field a front three of Di Maria, Messi and Garnacho at the Olympics. ",

The 21-year-old midfielder, who promised much when he arrived from Manchester United in January, has only played 36 minutes for the Andalusian giants, with head coach Quique Sanchez Flores showing no signs of playing him any more in the near future.  Hannibal has been somewhat ostracised at Sevilla in the last couple of weeks. Since a training ground bust-up with teammate Mariano Diaz, he has played just eight minutes, which came in the victory over Rayo Vallecano at Vallecas. Furthermore, he has been publicly scolded by Quique on multiple occasions, which has made clear his feelings on the youngster. As per Estadio Deportivo, Sevilla have no intention of buying Hannibal on a permanent basis this summer, which hardly comes as a surprise given his current situation. Los Nervionenses have a â¬18m buy clause in the deal that was negotiated with Man United, although at this stage, that wonât be triggered, and the Tunisian will return to Old Trafford. Itâs certainly been a sorry episode for all parties so far, although there is still time for Hannibal to rectify his Sevilla career. It remains to be seen whether he will be given the chance to do so, whether that be in training or in matches.","Itâs certainly been a sorry episode for all parties so far, although there is still time for Hannibal to rectify his Sevilla career.

The Dutch international consistently stated is preference to stay in Catalonia despite major interest from Premier League giants Manchester United. With Barcelona desperate to raise funds via a  sale, de Jong stood his ground on the situation, with his current contract running until 2026.  De Jong is yet to confirm his plans over an extension, despite his desire to stay, and the club may now look to sell again. If the 26-year-old starts next season without a new deal in place, his transfer value will decrease, as his contract ticks down. Despite a lack of progress at this stage, Barcelona are willing to hold firm on their push for a â¬100m fee, as per the latest update from Mundo Deportivo. That would a significant increase on the initial â¬60m bid put forward by Unitedâs domestic rivals Tottenham at the start of 2024.",That would a significant increase on the initial â¬60m bid put forward by Unitedâs domestic rivals Tottenham at the start of 2024.

Turner signed for Forest last summer as he made the switch from Arsenal. He married former NFL cheerleader Ashley Herron in 2022.  Herron revealed that Forest's Gonzalo Montiel accidentally broke her nose with a shot during the warm-up before a game. Herron told talkSPORT: 'I've got a broken nose right now because I went to a game and got hit in the nose. 'It happened during the warm up. It was [Gonzalo] Montiel. I don't think it's glitz and glamour.' Herron will feature in a documentary on Amazon Prime called Married to the Game which follows the wives and girlfriends of Premier League players during last summer's transfer window. Herron admits that it took some time to adapt following Turner's switch to the Premier League in 2022, when he signed for Arsenal from New England Revolution. She said: 'I don't think I was necessarily prepared for the intensity of the Premier League. We came from MLS and obviously that's not as high profile. 'This league is just developed in people's blood and it's a beautiful thing. The pressure for the players and their families is something I don't think you can prepare for.  'You have to just go through the journey and experience it and that's where you really learn the ins and outs of everything. 'We moved over to Arsenal when I was eight months pregnant and I had to move before Matt finished up his season. I came to the country without a place to live.' Since joining Forest, Turner has made 20 appearances, with 17 of those coming in the Premier League. However, he has been on the bench for Forest's last two league games following the signing of Matz Sels.","However, he has been on the bench for Forest's last two league games following the signing of Matz Sels."

The Spain international is free to negotiate with any club he pleases as things stand, but there is little clarity on where he will be playing next season.  Juventus, Aston Villa and most recently Barcelona have been linked to Hermoso over the course of the last few months, but on Thursday, Atletico Madrid President Enrique Cerezo suggested that a deal for him to remain was in the works. However Matteo Moretto has revealed exclusively to The Daily Briefing that the situation with Hermoso has not changed over the past week, and Atletico still have to negotiate with in order to re-sign him. The previous update on the 28-year-old was that Hermoso and Atletico were not miles apart on their demands, but both are digging their heels in. Equally, Hermoso is though to have interest from the Premier League, where his earnings have the potentially to at least be maintained, if not increased.","The previous update on the 28-year-old was that Hermoso and Atletico were not miles apart on their demands, but both are digging their heels in.

484,Tuchel 'falls out with Bayern star' who was dropped for 3-0 defeat to Leverkusen,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tuchel-falls-out-with-Bayern-star-who-was-dropped-for-3-0-defeat-to-Leverkusen/3300778,12 Feb,"Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel has reportedly fallen out with one of his defenders after dropping him for their dismal 3-0 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday evening.  The Bavarian giants were stunned by Xabi Alonso's men in a pivotal result for the title race, as the unfancied Bundesliga leaders racked up a five-point lead at the top of the table. Harry Kane and Co were powerless to prevent Leverkusen from recording a thumping win thanks to goals from Josip Stanisic - who is on loan from Bayern - Alex Grimaldo and a stoppage time strike by Jeremie Frimpong to cap off a memorable night. Tuchel had opted for a back three for the game, with Dayot Upamecano fielded alongside new signing Eric Dier and Kim Min-jae. But all the fallout from the loss continues to be felt, there was one high-profile player left 'angry' by the decision to leave him on the bench, according to Bild.  Dutch centre-back Matthijs de Ligt watched on from the sidelines for the entire 90 minutes, despite starting the last five Bundesliga matches in a row. However, Tuchel opted to switch from a back four and with Upamecano back in the team after injury, the German boss decided to put him back in the team alongside Dier and Kim, with De Ligt the man sacrificed. The former Ajax man - who joined Bayern in 2022 for around Â£68million - is 'completely frustrated' after being overlooked by Tuchel, who was accused of making a 'mistake' by adopting a back three for the game as his tactical gamble failed to pay off. De Ligt stressed after the game that he was fully fit and was not left out due to an injury and Bild added that he has 'long suspected he he has had a bad hand' with the ex-Chelsea boss.   It is no secret that Tuchel was desperately seeking a new centre-back in January and ended up bringing in Dier from Tottenham. Bild claims he was also looking at Barcelona's Ronald Araujo and Jonathan Tah from Leverkusen. For De Ligt, the 'bitter decision' from Tuchel gave him confirmation that the head coach was 'not a fan' of his. The report added that the two have endured a strained relationship this season and he will only have a future at the club if a new manager arrives. Indeed, Tuchel's future has come under speculation with Bayern floundering in the title race. Jose Mourinho's name has been linked with the role after the former Chelsea and Tottenham boss left Roma last month.  Fans are also appearing to turn on Tuchel after a sign at the entrance to the club's training ground was defaced with 'Tuchel Out'. But Tuchel was backed by Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen, who said the coach's position was safe despite their 'deserved' defeat. 'Nothing changes,' Dressen told BILD. 'We knew beforehand that it would be a difficult game. We would have liked a different result. We are concentrating on the next games. 'I don't like to repeat myself (about Tuchel's future), it remains as I just said.'","'I don't like to repeat myself (about Tuchel's future), it remains as I just said.'"

Chilling video captured the exact moment the 35-year-old male victim from Subang collapsed at Siliwangi Stadium in Bandung, West Java. The man, later identified as Septain Raharja, was competing in a friendly football match between 2 FLO FC Bandung and FBI Subang. Reports by local media PRFM News say that he was still breathing after the incident and rushed to a local hospital, but died soon afterwards. The horrifying video clip has since gone viral on social media, with football fans and players offering their condolences. ' RIP to that player,' commented one X user. 'This is the stuff of my nightmares. I lived through the San Francisco 'Quake of '89' that ended game 3 of the Baseball World Series,' wrote another. A third replied: 'That's awful and condolences. In my referee days I always kept an eye on the weather, it's in the FIFA manual I believe. For exactly this reason. Don't know if that was possible here or if there was a ref. This video will make it's way to FIFA and ref associations everywhere.' The tragic incident is the second time an Indonesian footballer has been struck by lightning in the last 12 months. A young football player in Bojonegoro, East Java was struck by lightning during the Soeratin U-13 Cup in 2023. The player, who suffered cardiac arrest, was rushed off the field and taken to the Ibnu Sina Hospital in Bojonegoro for medical treatment. The youngster was successfully revived after medical assistance and regained consciousness after approximately 20 minutes.  In 2023, a 21-year-old Brazilian footballer was also struck by lightning while on the pitch in Brazil. Caio Henrique de Lima Goncalves, 21, was playing for his Uniao Jaiirense team in a cup fixture in the southern state of Parana when he was jolted by the lightning strike He was rushed to hospital after collapsing on the pitch, but he later died of his injuries.

488,Neymar's bizarre penalty technique from teenage years re-emerge on social media,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Neymars-bizarre-penalty-technique-from-teenage-years-re-emerge-on-social-media/3300773,12 Feb,"It seems like a lifetime ago since a young Brazilian star named Neymar burst onto the scene at Santos before going on to star for Barcelona, PSG, and now Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia.  Now aged 32 and seemingly in the latter years of his career, fans of the South American are remembering how he once caused FIFA to change their rules on penalties because of how effective his spot-kick technique was. Neymar scored 73 goals in 142 appearances for Santos before securing a dream transfer to Barcelona for an initial Â£49million in 2013. Now a video has gone viral showing the superstar scoring penalties with his previous unusual style during his breakthrough years at Santos that he was eventually forced to stop doing. The Brazil icon scored 11 out of 14 penalties he took for Santos, with at least five of those being converted using Neymar's former unusual run-up.  Often taking the ball and putting it down on the spot, Neymar would approach his shot before stopping just in front of the ball, waiting for the goalkeeper to dive and then rolling his effort into the opposite corner. Opposition goalkeepers believe the action gave the spot-kicker an unfair advantage because it delayed their reaction time when trying to make a save.  His action contributed to FIFA bringing in a ban 14-years-ago that stopped the feint-style run-up from being used by players in the professional game. Football's global body labelled Neymar's former penalty technique as 'unsporting' and changed the law so that players can't stop running before striking the ball. A document released by FIFA at the time of the ruling stated: 'Feinting to kick the ball once the player has completed his run-up is considered an infringement of Law 14 and an act of unsporting behaviour for which the player must be cautioned.' The change meant players must be travelling in a forward motion at all times when running up to take a penalty, with the previous feint often being changed to a small jump instead.","The change meant players must be travelling in a forward motion at all times when running up to take a penalty, with the previous feint often being changed to a small jump instead."
489,Italian footballer gets life in prison for killing his 56-year-old ex-girlfriend,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Italian-footballer-gets-life-in-prison-for-killing-his-56-year-old-ex-girlfriend/3301125,13 Feb,"An Italian footballer has been jailed for life for stalking and beating his ex-girlfriend to death with a hammer, just a few weeks after she reported him for stalking.  Giovanni Padovani, a 28-year-old former centre-back who played for Sancataldese, was today handed a life sentence for murdering his ex-girlfriend, 56-year-old Alessandra Matteuzzi, outside her home on August 23 2022. Alessandra was on the phone to her sister, Stefania, who heard her screams as Padovani, also a former model, beat her to death, first with a hammer and his fists, then a baseball bat, and finally a bench he had picked up from a garden near her apartment in Via Dell'Arcoveggio, in Bologna, northern Italy. He had flown to the city to lie in wait outside her home, after his team told him to stay away from a training session. He ambushed her, and started beating her in a sick attack that Stefania heard over the phone.    She previously told a local TV station: 'She got out of her car and started screaming, 'No Giovanni, no, I beg you, help.' 'I was on the phone. I immediately called the [police] who arrived straight away.' While Alessandra survived the initial attack, she later died in hospital after suffering massive injuries. The pair were together for about a year, according to local media, but had spent most of their time apart as Alessandra lived in Bologna, while Padovani worked in Sicily. Stefania claimed they had a fight in January 2022 in which he smashed dishes and a light at her Bologna home. After they broke up, Padovani bombarded her with messages and calls, and she ended up reporting him to the police for stalking. But this did not stop him, and her neighbours previously told local media that he tried sabotaging her car, disconnecting her meter from the outside, and even tried to climb up her balcony.     One local resident said: 'She was very afraid of him because he had become persistent and she didn't want to let him in the house.' The judge at the Bologna court, Domenico Pasquariello, took just two hours to hand a sentence down today, and said that his stalking and predatory behaviour, as well as the premeditated nature of the attack, were aggravating factors. He reportedly tried to claim he was not in a fit state of mind at the time of the attack, telling the court: 'If I was completely lucid and capable I deserve life in prison. But if you consider that there is something abnormal, anomalous, in the conduct, then no. 'I wasn't well, because a person who is well doesn't kill another human being. I'm in a nightmare, I'm sorry, this is a bigger burden than prison.'     Stefania was reportedly only able to get a single sentence out following the hearing, and burst into tears as she left the courtroom. She said: 'Alessandra is no longer here, my sister is no longer here.' At the time of the murder, the case sparked outrage in Italy, after many claimed that the justice system failed to protect women from abusers. Bologna Chief Prosecutor Giuseppe Amato was previously forced to deny accusations of judicial negligence in the case. He said that while a probe into the stalking complaint was launched after Alessandra filed it on August 1 2022, the investigation grinded to a halt as witnesses were on holiday. 'We did what we could,' he said at the time, claiming that Alessandra's stalking report did not highlight 'situations of a concrete risk of violence, it was just the typical conduct of bothersome stalking'.","'We did what we could,' he said at the time, claiming that Alessandra's stalking report did not highlight 'situations of a concrete risk of violence, it was just the typical conduct of bothersome stalking'."
490,Is it ever OK to walk out on your team and leave early?,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Is-it-ever-OK-to-walk-out-on-your-team-and-leave-early/3301307,13 Feb,"With West Ham 4-0 down going into half-time during their clash with Arsenal, Sky Sports cameras panned outside to see thousands of fans storming out of the London stadium.  David Moyes' side suffered a nightmare collapse on home soil, with the Gunners adding two further goals in the second-half to complete a 6-0 stuffing. It was West Ham's biggest defeat at home since 1963, and the drone footage in the dying seconds of the first-half showed just how unhappy fans were with their team's shambolic performance. There is an unwritten rule in football that states: 'To be a 'true fan, you must stay until the end - no matter if your team is being humiliated. Though there is also the argument that once you have paid your money - for some it will be hundreds of pounds - you can do what you like. It has been a big talking point since Sunday's game, and it has caused a fierce debate among Mail Sport readers, who have given their opinions after we asked whether it was ever OK to walk out on your team and leave early.   One football fan from Shrewsbury insisted: 'You stay to the bitter end, no matter what. They're (sic) your team through the good and the bad'. This opinion was echoed by Chris Sutton on Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast this week. Sutton said: 'If you're a football supporter, you support your team through thick and thin, don't you? What did Jock Stein say? Football is nothing without fans. Show appreciation to players at the end of the game.' Another defence given was the amount that fans pay for tickets to watch their team. Nicki108 from Suffolk said: 'Their prerogative but at 60 quid a pop I wouldn't leave,' and another person responded to this comment adding: 'Exactly what's the point if you've already given the club your money.' Another person posted in the comments' section: 'As a true fan you take the rough with the smooth. 'Part and parcel of supporting your club is backing them through the ups and downs. If you leave early if the game isn't going your way, you aren't a fan, you are a customer.'     Michael Heath from Reading disagreed insisting that the team needs to give fans a reason to stay. He wrote: 'Do what you want when the match has gone that way. 'No point being the 12th man when the game is done so early. It's not a one-way street. 'The team/players need to also give the fans a reason to stay!' Another Mail Sport reader commented: 'Their money they can leave when they want.' While Cpt-Spot said: 'If you're 3 nil down and have a 2-3 hour drive home. Who'd blame them.' Though it would have taken a miracle for West Ham to salvage a result from 4-0 down, one person pointed out that fans can sometimes rue their decision to leave a game early. StevieMac from Birmingham commented: 'I remember a few years ago watching Wolves vs QPR. With ten minutes to go, Wolves were losing three nil. 'The fans were streaming out and then Wolves scored. Then they scored another, then another. 'Of course the fans who had left tried to force their way back in but it was too late. 'They missed a great last ten minutes. Taught me to stay to the end.'      One Arsenal fan made that mistake though and admitted they left the stadium with the Gunners 3-1 down with 20 minutes to play, and was at the tube station when they made it 4-3 in the 90th minute. West Ham's worrying dip in form meanwhile is delaying David Moyes' new contract as the club want to see a response to their current mess. Sources confirmed after a 2-0 win over Arsenal in December that they were ready to hand a new deal to the 60-year-old Scot whose current contract expires at the end of this season. Moyes even admitted two weeks ago that extension until June 2026 was on its way to being finalised. Yet West Ham have not won in the Premier League since that victory away at the Emirates Stadium and there is now an acceptance that they must prioritise their problems first.",Yet West Ham have not won in the Premier League since that victory away at the Emirates Stadium and there is now an acceptance that they must prioritise their problems first.

The billionaire United fan has passed the League's owners and directors test, clearing another hurdle in his bid to rejuvenate his boyhood club. Ratcliffe is on the verge of officially coming on board at United and his next step is for his deal to be signed off by the FA. This could happen in a few days and Ratcliffe has already made significant moves in his new role as head of United's football operations. Ratcliffe has offered to buy 25 per cent of the United's A shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange and he has until just before midnight on Friday to complete this transaction. This will go through as long as he has the approval of the Premier League and the FA, which should be formalities. The shares will then be sold and transferred to his control. United confirmed Ratcliffe's latest successive step when the club said: ""We have secured the approval of the Premier League."" ""Sir Jim Ratcliffeâs acquisition of 25 per cent of Manchester United FC, and further investment of $300 million in the club, has been approved by the Premier League Board following the completion of the Ownersâ and Directorsâ Test (OADT),"" a Premier League statement read. ""The Board agreed to the change of the clubâs ownership structure last week, and this has now been officially ratified by an Independent Oversight Panel. The Premier Leagueâs Ownersâ Charter has also been signed. 'This is the first acquisition of Control to be reviewed and approved by a new Independent Oversight Panel following changes to the process which were agreed by Premier League clubs in March 2023. The Premier League now awaits confirmation of the transactionâs completion."" The club announced the deal with Ratcliffe on Christmas Eve and the INEOS boss is paying Â£1.25bn for his 25 per cent stake in the club. United's 14-month sale process is nearly over and Ratcliffe has fought long and hard to come on board. He initially was interested in assuming full control of United from the Glazers, when they put the club up for sale in November 2022. Ratcliffe fought off interest from Qatar and Sheikh Jassim, but the Glazers were reluctant to give up control. The two sides finally agreed on their deal which sees Ratcliffe come in as a minority shareholder. He has also agreed to take over the club's football operations. Although Ratcliffe has yet to officially come on board, he has wasted no time in making his mark. Richard Arnold has left as CEO and Ratcliffe has lured Moroccan Omar Berrada across from Manchester City to replace him. Ratcliffe has also brought Sir Dave Brailsford on board as his right-hand man and the former cycling supremo has quit INEOS Grenadiers to focus on his new work at United. Jean-Claude Blanc has joined Ratcliffe and Brailsford on the United board and he has a wealth of experience from his time at Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus. Ratcliffe has much more to do and he is assessing John Murtough's role as director of football and, of course, Erik ten Hag's as manager. Ten Hag has met Ratcliffe and is said to be impressed by his new boss.

The Manchester United forward parked his McLaren 765LT on the pavement next to double yellow lines outside of the offices for a construction and property development company in Hale, Cheshire. The 26-year-old, wearing a black Chrome Hearts tracksuit, was then pictured returning to his car and removing the notice before leaving in the Â£280,000 supercar. It comes just weeks after Rashford was given a parking ticket in nearby Wilmslow after spending an hour in the upmarket Juniper Restaurant with United teammate Tyrell Malacia. Rashford also narrowly missed a similar incident in November, with a video of him returning to his car before he could be fined going viral on social media.  The United academy graduate is a noted car enthusiast, and also owns a Rolls-Royce Black Badge Cullinan, and a Lamborghini Urus Performante, worth Â£350,000. Rashford's future at Old Trafford had appeared in doubt last month after he had called in sick after being spotted in a Belfast nightclub just days before his side were due to face Newport County. The incident drew the ire of the England international's teammates, after they had been informed that he was too ill to train ahead of the FA Cup fourth round clash. Despite the controversy, Rashford responded emphatically after being named in the starting XI for United's next Premier League game by Erik ten Hag.  Just minutes into their visit to Molineux to take on Wolves Rashford fired his team into the lead, with United going on to triumph against Gary O'Neil's side in a seven-goal thriller. Rashford has since retained his place in victories over West Ham and Aston Villa with the club having recovered from a poor run of form around Christmas to sit just six points behind Tottenham in fourth.

Following a goalless first half, Upamecano was at the centre of drama that unfolded midway through the second period as he was shown a straight red card for a stood-showing challenge on the ankle of Gustav Isaksen inside the penalty area. Ciro Immobile converted the resulting spot kick and Bayern were unable to respond, falling to a slender defeat after failing to register any of their 17 shots on target at Stadio Olimpico. Shortly after the full-time whistle blew, Bayern addressed the racist abuse Upamecano received on social media following the defender's dismissal. A statement on 'X' read: ""FC Bayern strongly condemn the racist comments being directed towards Dayot Upamecano on social media. Anyone who comments hateful words such as these is no fan of our club. We're all behind you, Upa!""

Kingsley Coman and Mathys Tel are two other Bayern players who have also been the subjects of racist abuse over the last 12 months. Upamecano joined Bayern in the summer of 2021 and has since established himself as a first-team regular at the Allianz Arena, making 105 appearances across all competitions. Despite suffering with a few niggling injuries, the 25-year-old has managed to play 24 times for Thomas Tuchel's side this season, including six starts in the Champions League. Upamecano, who will miss the last-16 second-leg clash with Lazio in three weeks' time, has been part of a Bayern side that have lost their last two games in the space of just five days and are at risk of ending the 2023-24 campaign without a trophy. The Bavarians are tasked with overturning a one-goal deficit to beat Lazio if they wish to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals, while they find themselves five points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen following last weekend's 3-0 defeat to Xabi Alonso's side. Bayern were also eliminated in the DFB-Pokal to third-tier outfit Saarbrucken earlier this season, and the pressure is mounting on head coach Tuchel, who has insisted that he is not fearing the sack. ""I'm not worried about my future or potential sack,"" Tuchel said at his post-match press conference. ""We did everything to lose this match... it was in our hands.

495,Hodgson insists Crystal Palace can come through 'bad period' after Blues defeat,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hodgson-insists-Crystal-Palace-can-come-through-bad-period-after-Blues-defeat/3301136,13 Feb,"Roy Hodgson insisted he can steer Crystal Palace away from the Premier Leagueâs relegation zone despite Chelseaâs late, late show piling the pressure on the 76-year-old manager.  Jefferson Lermaâs swerving screamer handed Palace the lead but Conor Gallagher equalised before Mauricio Pochettinoâs men scored twice in stoppage time â first through Gallagher and then Enzo Fernandez as they silenced Selhurst Park. On a night when Palace's supporters showed their frustration towards the clubâs hierarchy with banners branding them âweakâ, Hodgson said he felt their pain after this defeat. âIt's a bad period,â said Hodgson who faces Premier League matches against Everton and Burnley next.â There are 14 games. A lot of games. A lot of points. We've shown enough, even in some of the other defeats we've had. I don't have any concerns in that respect. âBut I do want to emphasise that there is no complacency. We realise we are at the wrong end of the table. We realise points are necessary to climb away from the relegation zone. âIf the question is, do I think this group of players are good enough to get us out of this? I do. They've shown a lot tonight which gives me even more faith and belief that they'll get there.â Hodgson added: 'I feel extremely sorry for them because to go home and sleep on that defeat is going to be very tough for everybody. The fans were very good throughout. They must be gutted because, like me at 85 minutes, I was not thinking we are going to lose this game.â Chelsea did consider selling Gallagher in January but much to his managerâs relief, he stayed. 'Always he decided, what he told me, was to stay at Chelsea,â Pochettino said, before being asked if he should be tied down to a new deal.   'It is about him and the club,' the Blues boss added. 'I am not suffering from this type of thing. He still has one year more on his contract (expires June 2025). That is a matter for him and the club.â Chelsea have bounced back since being hammered at home by Wolves â a defeat which put Pochettino under pressure. Since then, they have beaten Aston Villa in the FA Cup and Palace here. âI don't care about the rumours, the tension, the pressure or the stresses,â Pochettino said. 'We know really well what is our reality and we are going to keep working.â","âI don't care about the rumours, the tension, the pressure or the stresses,â Pochettino said.

With Jude Bellingham out of action for another week or two, Brahim has been slated to perform in his absence.  The former Milan player has been in inspired form since Carlo Ancelotti began using him more regularly, and alarm bells were ringing when he limped off in the final 20 minutes nursing his leg. There was concern that he might have strained or torn his hamstring, but after tests, Diario AS have confirmed that Brahim has not damaged the muscles, but merely pickd up a knock there. He is likely to be available against Rayo Vallecano this weekend, although it is not yet clear if Carlo Ancelotti will risk him in a relatively low-stakes game. Brahim has been a breathe of fresh air for the Real Madrid attack this season, providing passing and dribbling whenever Vinicius Junior has been absent, or Ancelotti requires a different option to Rodrygo Goes. With Bellingham out, he has a shot at a run of games to produce, and impress Sapin manager Luis de la Fuente.","Brahim has been a breathe of fresh air for the Real Madrid attack this season, providing passing and dribbling whenever Vinicius Junior has been absent, or Ancelotti requires a different option to Rodrygo Goes.

497,Phillips admits Guardiola calling him 'overweight' was 'toughest' moment,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Phillips-admits-Guardiola-calling-him-overweight-was-toughest-moment/3299203,11 Feb,"West Ham midfielder Kalvin Phillips has opened up on the decision to leave Man City on loan after Pep Guardiola called him overweight.  The England international joined the Irons in the January transfer window after a difficult 18 months in Manchester. During his time at the Etihad, Phillips was slammed by Guardiola as the Spaniard labelled his as 'overweight'. Speaking to The Sun, Phillips has admitted that the period where his manager slammed him in the media was the toughest of his career. 'After the World Cup was probably the toughest, when Pep came out and said I was overweight. He was right to do so but there are different ways to go about it,' he said.   Phillips continued to reveal the context behind Guardiola's comments before admitting that the comments affected his mother. 'Pep was frustrated I didn't come back into training early but it was just a miscommunication between the people at City and myself,' he continued. 'Pep wanted me to come in the day after we finished the tournament and be involved in friendlies and stuff. I never got that information because if he asked me to be there, I would have. 'It was just a misunderstanding, he was very frustrated with me coming back 1.5kg over my target weight. 'It took a big knock on my confidence and how I felt at City. My family were not happy about it, either. Especially Mum.' Phillips has had a tough start to life at West Ham, inadvertently setting up Dominic Solaker to score against the Hammers on his debut. However, the midfielder is keen to regain his form as he targets a place in the England squad for Euro 2024. Phillips admitted that he spoke to Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate, who advised him to remain in the Premier League rather than seek a move abroad. 'I definitely wouldn't have been at this summer's Euros if I hadn't moved in January,' he admitted. 'I spoke to England boss Gareth Southgate about a few teams a month before the January window and he influenced me to stay in the Premier League rather than go abroad. 'I wanted that same feeling of playing regularly, otherwise there was definitely a chance somebody else would play instead of me and that would be gut-wrenching. 'I wanted to give myself the best chance of making the Euros.'",'I wanted to give myself the best chance of making the Euros.'
498,RIATH AL-SAMARRAI: This incessant tinkering in football is sporting madness!,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/RIATH-AL-SAMARRAI-This-incessant-tinkering-in-football-is-sporting-madness/3299018,11 Feb,"I've not yet got around to reading The Ashley Book of Knots, which is awfully lazy of me because it came out in 1944. But if you want to learn about knots, this book has 3,857 of them. Clifford W Ashley sure knew his stuff, perhaps more than any knotter who ever lived. Though I do wonder if he saw the threat coming from the International Football Association Board.  Those boys and girls within the gameâs law-making department love tying a knot even more than he did. Crikey, they might be making a serious run at his turf. So what about a new book, an unauthorised, unapproved biography of their recent work: How Football Tied Itself In Knots And Choked Until It Was Blue. Itâs been almost six years since these guardians of the game wrote VAR into football and a few days since we heard rumblings of a blue card and sin bins. In between they took out their crayons once or twice to amend what constitutes a handball, so they have certainly made themselves known. But letâs focus on those blue cards, and their brainwave for 10-minute sin bins for dissent and cynical fouls, because that is a proper knot within a knot. Thatâs a sheepshank within a manger within a bowline. They tied it so tight they are now struggling to get out of it. What was initially drafted as a sin-bin trial in the professional game has drifted to something less bullish after facing the fury of many in the game. The UEFA president Alexander Ceferin called it âthe death of footballâ, which was a little dramatic but it was on the right side of the line at least.   As such, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) will talk it over some more. Theyâve put their foot on the ball, if you like, and will instead kick around their thoughts at the AGM next month. Letâs hope itâs a short conversation and letâs hope, too, this incessant tinkering and tweaking is seen for the exercise in sporting madness that it is. Because what was that old phrase? Football is a simple game â 22 men chase a ball and a bunch of administrators find a way to bugger it all up. That is what has happened over the past few years and it is the line of misadventure that a blue card would extend. It simply isnât needed. It wasnât needed in the 54 years we have had yellow and red cards and it isnât needed now. Even if IFABâs heart is in the right place, noting that dissent is a colossal part of footballâs refereeing crisis, then its head is in the clouds. Itâs the timing that is particularly baffling. This season has already seen an effort to clamp down on dissent and the referees are holding up their end â the numbers tell us they have given out 153 yellow cards for the offence in the Premier League this season, compared to 87 for the entirety of the 2022-23 campaign. But within those digits has been a trend in a promising direction. I spoke to the statisticians at Opta this week and they have a breakdown of the figures, naturally. Going month by month, what started as an average of 0.83 cautions for dissent per game in August has in fact tracked downwards â it is now at 0.58 and none of the past three months have been higher than the four that went before. It is far too soon to rule if the deterrent has been effective and the four yellows for back-chat given to each of Andreas Pereira, Bruno Fernandes and Nicolas Jackson suggest some skulls are too dense for the message. But it is surely too early to abandon the experiment for a change that would disfigure the sport as we know it. More matches of 11 against 10, more teams sitting back and hanging on, more reasons to gripe, more reasons to wonder, âwhy did it have to be like thisâ? Which of course has been the upshot of so many of these incursions. The introduction of VAR has been little short of an act of vandalism; a horribly imperfect solution to a game that deluded itself into believing it was too important for mistakes. So important that it tricked itself into a massive blunder. That silence we hear so regularly after a goal is scored, when we wait to learn if it will be permitted by some distant power, might just be the most depressing sound in all of sport. And yet it is only marginally more nauseating than the chatter as we go by frame-by-frame in dissecting the modern meaning of handball. And rest assured, a blue card would build on those discussions.    Iâm not so fussed about how it applies to cynical fouls. But a game-changing minefield awaits around dissent, because that has always been a subjective situation and a question of what a referee is willing to tolerate. It might not sit well with the letter of the lawbook, but it does reflect reality. We can see the issue that lurks around this corner â if youâre interested, Peter Bankes has overseen 21 Premier League games this season and shown 20 yellows for dissent. Anthony Taylor is second with 13 in 30 games and Chris Kavanagh only nine from 13 matches, which included no caution when Virgil Van Dijk appeared to ask if he had been drinking during Liverpool v Arsenal. Usually we want referees to apply their own judgment to these situations. We used to call it good game-management. But if the penalty is as stiff as going down a man for 10 minutes, with all of the competitive consequences that might bring, it is presumably an area ripe for inconsistencies. It raises a question: why are the same people who want perfection in all aspects of the game now looking to increase the circumstances where imperfections exist? What an excellent bit of knotting that would be by IFAB. Clifford W Ashley would be proud. Better still, he could rise from the grave and tie these jokers to the mast before they commit such a mess to paper. The peculiar tale of Two Chelseas I went to two Chelsea matches last week, the second of which was a brilliant destruction of Aston Villa at a ground where Villa had beaten both Arsenal and Manchester City. The first, three days earlier, was a home loss against Wolves where they embarrassed themselves and sparked a social media mutiny from Thiago Silvaâs wife.   Weird time for Mauricio Pochettino. He has generally been preserved from the hottest edges of criticism at Chelsea, because their greater problems start at higher places. But it is equally true that he has not yet delivered anything close to his best at the club. In a peculiar way, such a view only strengthened with the win at Villa: if these players are capable of this level, how are their lower extremes still possible? Part of that is the nature of a young squad. But raising the baseline of performance and reducing the variance is a key tenet of coaching. So that one falls on him. We can assume he will return Chelsea to steadier ground if he is given time. But one win at Villa does not answer the questions thrown up by Wolves and too many other games like it.",We can assume he will return Chelsea to steadier ground if he is given time.

499,Barcelona will listen to offers for economic lever signing just two years on,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-will-listen-to-offers-for-economic-lever-signing-just-two-years-on/3301623,2 days ago,"Barcelona will be forced into at least one major sale this summer, and would probably like to make one or two more to bolster their accounts. Jules Kounde has been picked out as one of their assets that could be moved on this summer.  The Frenchman was meant to be a strategic signing for the coming years, arriving alongside Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski when President Joan Laporta executed the economic levers which are causing so much havoc currently. Relations have deteriorated somewhat over the past 12 months though. Kounde has not continued the development he showed at Sevilla, and has been unhappy about playing out of position at right-back more often than not, despite Xavi Hernandez promising he would return to his position this season with the arrival of Joao Cancelo. MD say that Barcelona will listen to offers for him this summer. They are well stocked in the middle of defence, with Ronald Araujo one of the cornerstone pieces that they will try to renew. Inigo Martinez has just arrived, and Andreas Christensen is another case that is in the air, as Barcelona wait to see how the pivot experiment goes, while youngster Pau Cubarsi is set to become a regular member of the first team next year. Ultimately, the defining factor has been Koundeâs performances. At the start of this season, Kounde had a run in central defence where he looked his old self, but amongst numerous issues for the Blaugrana in defence, his level has been below that of his competition wherever he has played since an injury in September.","Ultimately, the defining factor has been Koundeâs performances.

The Gunners were 4-0 up by the interval courtesy of goals from William Saliba, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel and Leandro Trossard. And further goals after half-time from Saka and Declan Rice compounded the home side's misery. It leaves Moyes without a win in five league games having previously beaten Arsenal twice this season â 3-1 in the Carabao Cup and 2-0 in the league. âA really poor day for us,â said Moyes, who returned to the club in December 2019. âVery difficult to explain, really. Arsenal played really well. (Itâs) difficult to explain how we played so poorly.  âDisappointing thing for me, I donât think since Iâve come back to the club my teams (have) defended that way, ever. âWe were weak today. We didnât do the jobs well enough. We didnât fight to contain it harder and make sure we didnât concede. We could have conceded other goals as well. âArsenal went up another level today if Iâm being honest. I saw that in them. Maybe they had something to prove as well, coming here and getting a result. But I canât only talk about us, and we werenât at the races at all.â The performance saw home supporters leave at half-time. Though Moyes was circumspect, citing the good times Hammersâ fans have enjoyed in recent years. That includes winning the Europa Conference League last season. He added: âTo be a football supporter, especially this club who people know a lot more about than me, I came back twice to keep them out of relegation â there is always going to be bad times.  âIt was only three months ago we were having probably the best time West Ham has ever had. âLetâs be fair, probably the last three years has probably been as good a time as West Ham has had. Sixth, seventh in the league, semi-final of Europe. A final of a European competition. I still think that this club has grown. âUndoubtedly weâve had a terrible day today so I understand totally them leaving. Sometimes football clubs are going to have a bad day. We had a bad day. But I certainly wonât forget the good ones.â",âUndoubtedly weâve had a terrible day today so I understand totally them leaving. Sometimes football clubs are going to have a bad day.

502,Sane punches camera as Bayern Munich humbled and Harry Kane calls out stars,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Sane-punches-camera-as-Bayern-Munich-humbled-and-Harry-Kane-calls-out-stars/3299570,11 Feb,"Leroy Sane took his anger out on a television camera following Bayern Munich's 3-0 away defeat by Bundesliga title rivals Bayer Leverkusen.  The league's top two faced off at the BayArena on Saturday night with plenty on the line. If Leverkusen won, they'd extend their lead at the summit of the table, while if Bayern got the better of their hosts, then Thomas Tuchel's side would leapfrog them into top spot. Unfortunately for those of a Bayern persuasion, it was Leverkusen who ran out comfortable winners. Goals from Josip Stanisic - who is on loan from Bayern, and Alex Grimaldo sent Xabi Alonso's men on their way. However, there was more to come deep into second-half stoppage time. After being awarded a corner, Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saw it fit to join in on the attacking effort and made his way up the pitch, leaving his own goal vacant in the process. That was a decision that soon backfired, with Jeremie Frimpong going up the other end and bagging a third for Leverkusen. Sane was the Bayern player tasked with tracking back to his goal-line to try and prevent Frimpong's strike, but the ex-Manchester City man's efforts were in vain. After the ball ended up in the net, the Bayern star booted it away before smacking the camera inside the goal in anger. The 28-year-old has been one of Bayern's standout players so far this term, with his record of eight goals and 11 assists the second-highest behind talismanic forward Harry Kane. The ex-Tottenham ace also endured a miserable evening and managed just one shot on target. Following the full-time whistle, Kane demanded an instant improvement from his team-mates as they look to keep their title hopes alive and prevent Leverkusen from running away with the league. ""We didnât play well with the ball,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I thought the pressure, especially in the first half and even in the second half, we pressed them well, but every time we won it back we gave it straight back to them. ""That allowed them to build momentum. In the final third we werenât good in one-vs-one battles, we werenât good in duels, the final delivery wasnât there today, so a really disappointing day with the ball."" Kane went on to add that though this latest defeat was a painful one, all hope is not lost. ""Weâre five points behind now but there are still a lot of games to go,"" he explained. ""This one hurts, we wanted a different outcome, but we have to focus on, first, the Champions League, and obviously the next game. There are a lot of games to be played and we have to try and make up as many points as we can, as quickly as we can.""","""This one hurts, we wanted a different outcome, but we have to focus on, first, the Champions League, and obviously the next game.

De Ligt, 24, came through the academy at Ajax where he worked with Erik ten Hag before lucrative transfers to Juventus and Bayern, however, speculation over the defender's long-term future has been rumbling on for months. A Premier League move has been touted on more than one occasion and it's already been reported that United have plans to overhaul their defence in the summer. Acquiring De Ligt - a player he knows well - would certainly appeal to Ten Hag, who has previously turned to players he worked with in Amsterdam since taking the top job at Old Trafford. And Bayern would likely be open to doing a deal with their European rivals given that German outlet Bild claim De Ligt is not wanted by Tuchel, who is unimpressed with the Dutchman. De Ligt was an unused substitute in Bayern's chastening 3-0 loss against title rivals Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend with the defender later confirming to fans that he is fully fit. Tuchel preferred on-loan Tottenham defender Eric Dier to De Ligt, effectively relegating the former Ajax man to fourth-choice in the Bayern Munich pecking order. The face that Tuchel doesn't view De Ligt as an important part of his squad represents a significant boost for Ten Hag and Manchester United ahead of the summer transfer window, where it's expected they will reshape their squad. It emerged on Tuesday that Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal for a minority stake in the club, worth Â£1.25billion, has taken a step closer to completion after the British billionaire passed the Premier League's owners and directors test. As outlined by Mirror Football, the next step is for the Football Association to sign off on the deal, which was struck with the Glazer family in the build-up to Christmas. The deal, which will see Ratcliffe acquire a 25 per cent stake in his boyhood club, will give Ineos control of sporting operations at the club, meaning Ratcliffe and his team will have a big say in recruitment moving forward. Full ratification of the deal, which is now expected imminently, comes some 14 months after the Glazer family first invited takeover proposals from interested parties.","Full ratification of the deal, which is now expected imminently, comes some 14 months after the Glazer family first invited takeover proposals from interested parties."

In 1997, the Blues were a completely different club. Having won their first major trophy in more than 20 years the season prior, the Stamford Bridge outfit set about crafting a team capable of winning the league title. In came players who would leave a lasting legacy at the club. The likes of Celestine Babayaro, Graeme Le Saux, Gus Poyet and Tore Andre Flo were all snapped up ahead of the 1997-98 campaign under their exciting coach Ruud Gullit. The other notable additional that summer was an experienced shot stopper from Eredivisie giants Feyenoord at a cost of Â£2.5million, which at the time made the Dutchman the most expensive goalkeeper in England. Luckily for Chelsea, he turned out to be worth every penny as he made 179 appearances during a six-year stay in west London.  Blues fans would come to adore the 31-time Netherlands international Ed de Goey before he was unceremoniously usurped by another beloved figure, Carlo Cudicini. But unlike the Italian, De Goey got his hands on major trophies as the Chelsea No1. After winning a top-flight title and four Dutch Cups with Feyenoord, the then 31-year-old came straight into Gullit's side and formed a formidable back five that was later enhanced by the addition of World Cup winner Marcel Desailly in 1998. De Goey made 43 appearances for Chelsea in his debut campaign. He averaged a little more than one goal-per-game conceded and made crucial saves as the Blues lifted both the League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners Cup. He claimed his third major trophy at the end of the 1999-2000 season, however a particular De Goey contribution that year may be the most abiding memory of the 6ft 6ins stopper among the wider footballing public. De Goey was the unfortunate goalkeeper between the sticks when Nwankwo Kanu produced his most iconic moment in an Arsenal shirt as the Gunners rallied from two goals down to win 3-2 at Stamford Bridge on October 29, 1999. Arsene Wenger's men went behind to headed goals from Tore Andre Flo and Dan Petrescu before the Nigerian took over proceedings in the final 15 minutes of the London derby. De Goey could do nothing about Kanu's steered finish with the outside of his right boot and was similarly helpless to stop his thumping drive to the near post eight minutes later.    But the Dutchman was left with egg on his face as time ran out in the tie - and he inexplicably advanced to meet the forward near corner flag - as the Gunners chased a winner. Kanu feinted to cross into the box but instead cut the ball inside De Goey, who was left stranded outside his area, and whipped his shot from an impossibly narrow angle past Desailly and Frank Leboeuf retreating to the goaline. The former Inter Milan and Ajax striker's three efforts were the first the keeper had conceded in front of his home fans that season. It was a rare blemish. Chelsea finished the campaign as FA Cup winners and De Goey reached two prestigious landmarks. He made a club-record number of appearances in a campaign (59) and kept the most clean sheets (27), although both of these achievements have since been eclipsed. The end of the 1999-2000 campaign brought a close to his time as Chelsea's No1 as Carlo Cudicini was aquired from Italian side Castel di Sangro. De Goey's Premier League appearances fell from 37 to 15 and eventually to just two in the 2002-03 campaign before he departed for then-First Division Stoke City that summer. His three years with the Potters were largely unremarkable, with the side comfortably situated in mid-table in the second-tier. The Gouda-native eventually called time on his career at the age of 40 in 2006. Some 12 years prior he had played every minute for the Netherlands at the 1994 World Cup. His final appearance for the national team came in 1998.   De Goey quickly pivoted to a coaching career after his playing days were over, moving back down to London to become a first team coach for QPR. However, he was only in the role for six months before his contract was terminated by new chairman Gianni Paladini. He then opted to return to the Netherlands where he joined Dutch side RKC Waalwijk as a goalkeeping coach in 2010. Four years later and he was off again, this time to DHC Delft, a lower-league Dutch side, before moving to his current team VOC Rotterdam in 2018. Away from the coaching, De Goey also runs a successful goalkeeping school in Berkel which is a town north of Rotterdam.","Away from the coaching, De Goey also runs a successful goalkeeping school in Berkel which is a town north of Rotterdam."
507,How Cole Palmer has progressed at Chelsea ahead of Manchester City return,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/How-Cole-Palmer-has-progressed-at-Chelsea-ahead-of-Manchester-City-return/3301666,2 days ago,"Cole Palmer has thrived since leaving hometown club Manchester City to join Premier League rivals Chelsea in search of regular first-team football. Palmer made the move, in a deal worth up to Â£42.5million, in the summer after a treble-winning season with the Citizens. Ahead of Palmerâs return to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, the PA news agency looks at the impressive numbers he has posted since leaving City. Cole Palmer has impressed for Chelsea this season  After coming through the ranks at City, Palmer broke into the first-team squad during the 2021-22 campaign. Over three seasons, he made 41 appearances, scored six goals and added two assists in all competitions. In his time at City, he played a total of 1,482 minutes but he has surpassed that with 2,178 minutes in under six months, and just 28 games, with Chelsea. The goal contributions have also risen with the 21-year-old scoring 12 and providing nine assists so far for the Blues. One of those goals came against his old club in December when he scored a late penalty at Stamford Bridge in a thrilling 4-4 draw. Having been given more game time at Chelsea, Palmer has developed into a first-team regular instead of potentially a rotational player for City. Cole Palmer won the Super Cup with Manchester City  The last 18 months have not been acceptable by Chelseaâs standards. The Blues were champions of Europe in 2021 but went without a trophy last season, finishing 12th in the Premier League. However, despite continued poor league form this season, Chelsea are still in both domestic cups and face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final later this month. That is in large part due to the performances of Palmer, who has been the star turn of the Chelsea team this season. Mauricio Pochettino can also call upon the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Christopher Nkunku and Conor Gallagher but he is yet to find a consistent winning blend. As well as landing the treble, Palmer also scored the equaliser on the way to City winning their maiden Super Cup on penalties against Sevilla last August. The potential is there for Palmer to add to his silverware collection with Chelsea. Cole Palmer made his England debut against Malta in November  Palmer received his first England call-up last November following his impressive performances for Chelsea. He joined the Three Lions for their Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia, making appearances in both games off the bench. Before Euro 2024 this summer, England play four friendly internationals â two in March and two in June. Palmer has a lot of competition for a place from the likes of Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden, James Maddison and Jarrod Bowen. However, his recent performances certainly give him a chance of earning further caps before Gareth Southgate names his squad for the tournament in Germany.","However, his recent performances certainly give him a chance of earning further caps before Gareth Southgate names his squad for the tournament in Germany."
508,Utd fans insist Casemiro's reaction to being booked is the funniest thing ever,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Utd-fans-insist-Casemiros-reaction-to-being-booked-is-the-funniest-thing-ever/3300159,12 Feb,"Manchester United fans have reacted on social media after Casemiro was shown a yellow card during Manchester United's clash with Aston Villa.  Erik ten Hag's side took an early lead at Villa Park, with Rasmus Hojlund continuing his Premier League hot streak to fire them ahead after just 17 minutes. The hosts fought back as they hunted an equaliser throughout the remainder of the opening 45 minutes, but United repeatedly denied them an equaliser with Andre Onana making a pair of solid saves. As Villa continued pressing forward, Matty Cash was bombing down the right flank before Casemiro intervened, bringing the Polish full-back down and being booked by referee Robert Jones. Clearly dumbfounded by Jones' decision to caution him, the former Real Madrid midfielder cut an exasperated figure as he exaggeratedly gestured towards the officials.  Casemiro's inordinate reaction to the decision was enjoyed by supporters on social media, with some claiming the clip would soon attain meme status. One supporter wrote: 'Casemiroâs reaction to getting booked is the funniest thing I have ever seen.'     Another agreed: 'Someone please clip Casemiroâs reaction to that yellow or spam tag me. funniest s*** Iâve seen.' A further user added: 'Tremendous physical comedy from Casemiro there trying to plead his way out of getting a yellow, but also make sure it doesn't count as dissent so he gets a booking anyway.' Another predicted the clip will soon find common usage online: 'That Casemiro reaction is so obviously going to be a meme that Iâm already bored of it.'",Another predicted the clip will soon find common usage online: 'That Casemiro reaction is so obviously going to be a meme that Iâm already bored of it.'

Xavi may well also be without Torres who is nursing a hamstring injury. Yet the Spain international doesnât seem too far away from a return after posting the following image on social media today.

The visitors made the most of a sluggish performance from Massimiliano Allegriâs men, who still trail leaders Inter Milan by seven points having played a game more. Arkadiusz Milik was guilty of wasting most of the home sideâs good chances as Udinese held firm for only their second win in 13 Serie A games which moves them three points clear of the relegation zone. Italy Soccer Serie A  Looking to bounce back from last weekâs loss to Inter, Juventus looked unlikely to be duly troubled in a strong start which saw Andrea Cambiaso and Federico Chiesa come close. Udinese goalkeeper Maduka Okoye was busy early on, saving well from Milikâs close-range header then denying Federico Gatti who should have done better from the edge of the box. The visitors grabbed the lead against the run of play in the 25th minute when Giannetti bundled home the loose ball after a free-kick was flicked on by Thomas Kristensen deep into the home box. Italy Soccer Serie A  Milik failed to reach a cross-shot from Cambiaso that caused panic in the Udinese box and it was clear the home side were once again missing striker Dusan Vlahovic, who was ruled out with a groin strain. Milik headed straight at Okoye and it could have got worse for Juventus on the stroke of half-time when Sandi Lovric fired a speculative effort over from just outside the box. Italy Soccer Serie A  Allegriâs men hardly improved after the break as they huffed forward for little reward, although they did briefly think they had levelled on the hour mark. A corner was headed back for Milik to nod home but celebrations were cut short as the referee ruled the ball had drifted out of play in the course of the initial set-piece. Chiesa rammed a 72nd-minute effort over the bar while Kenan Yildiz was inches from connecting with Cambiasoâs left-wing cross in front of goal as Udinese managed to hold on for a famous win.",Chiesa rammed a 72nd-minute effort over the bar while Kenan Yildiz was inches from connecting with Cambiasoâs left-wing cross in front of goal as Udinese managed to hold on for a famous win.

514,Celebrity football catfisher 'cons ANOTHER victim' after prison release,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Celebrity-football-catfisher-cons-ANOTHER-victim-after-prison-release/3300787,12 Feb,"Convicted football fraudster Medi Abalimba has been accused of trying to steal money from an American nurse he allegedly wooed by pretending he played for Chelsea - just months after he was released from prison, MailOnline can reveal today.  The whereabouts of Abalimba, 34, had been unknown since an ITV documentary aired last November about the fraudster who conned Love Island's Georgia Steel and Thierry Henry's ex-wife out of tens of thousands of pounds. Abalimba was jailed for four years in 2014 after impersonating ex Chelsea footballer Gael Kakuta to fund a flash lifestyle. He was then jailed again in 2021 for four years and two months after he admitted 15 counts of fraud in which he plundered the bank accounts of model Chloe Henry after claiming to be a US Navy Seal in a Â£160,000 scam. The Ministry of Justice confirmed to MailOnline Abalimba is no longer in custody. But MailOnline can reveal it has been alleged he has been hanging around the Â£400-a-night Marriott hotel in swanky Mayfair in a Â£190,000 Mercedes-Benz G-Class. Last month he was snapped in Malaga, southern Spain, where it is claimed he tried to steal more than $1,000 from Zhane Wright's credit card, an ordeal that left the nurse feeling terrified. The 29-year-old believed his name was 'Gyle' but became spooked when she uncovered his true identity after she found a picture of his passport at the four-star hotel Anahita Boutique where they had been staying. Miss Wright exclusively told MailOnline she got an alert on her phone hours earlier that an attempt had been made to take $1,318.68 from her credit card. A total of $445.06 was withdrawn from her bank account. Abalimba was not in the room at the time and she fears he is to blame for the attempted raid on her account. MailOnline attempted to contact Abalimba on the two mobile phone numbers provided to us. One rang twice before a message said the number was currently unavailable, while we have left a voicemail message on the other.     Miss Wright discovered her cards went missing one evening while the pair were on the romantic break, but claims they reappeared again after the swindler returned. She hurriedly packed her belongings and scarpered barefooted from the hotel in an Uber in the dead of night, leaving Abalimba snoring in bed as she jetted back to London where she reported what had happened to Scotland Yard. The Met Police has confirmed to MailOnline there has been an allegation of an unsuccessful attempt of theft from a credit card in Spain. The force did not confirm the allegation was made against Abalimba when asked by this publication. MailOnline has had sight of emails, the withdrawn amounts from Miss Wright's bank account, and has seen some private WhatsApp messages between the pair to corroborate the allegations. Miss Wright, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, first locked eyes with Abalimba in August last year outside the London Marriott hotel in Grosvenor Square ahead of a night out with a friend. When she returned to the hotel a valet handed her a yellow Post-It note, seen by MailOnline, which had a mobile phone number written in black biro and 'Gyle Chelsea football player'. 'I remember he wasnât ugly, I guess he was checking me out. I was on the phone my friend was with me and said he was a good looking guy. I Googled what Chelsea was and saw it was a soccer team,' she says. 'I feel like not in a sense of dating somebody [it impressed me], but being financially stable yes. I'm not an ugly girl and I have had a bad encounter with an American athlete before.' What followed, she says, was months of chats over the phone with Abalimba who spoke in a French accent, in which he told her the mother of his two children had died, and continually broke promises to meet up with her in Los Angeles, Paris, and New York.             Last month, having returned to London for a modelling audition in Manchester, the young nurse decided to contact Abalimba believing he lived in a Mayfair townhouse. But he told her he 'was in Malaga getting treatment from a specialist for a knee injury' and told her he would book her a ticket to fly over. In the end she paid the Â£150 ticket herself as she says he told her the airline wanted to see his card when he arrived at the airport and promised to pay her back. She took a Ryanair flight to the Spanish tourist city where he greeted her moments after her plane touched the tarmac, and the pair were finally able to speak to each other face-to-face for the first time. While out there they 'went out on dates' to restaurants eating pizza and drinking cocktails, cuddled in bed, and snuggled up together on a romantic horse-drawn carriage ride along the beachfront. 'I thought I like this guy, he is a normal guy I'm enjoying this,' she said. 'I'm in Spain it's nice weather we are having a good time and we are finally spending time together. 'We are going out to eat, having drinks and having good conversation. I thought he was a nice guy, attractive... I could see myself taking this guy seriously.' But things turned sinister on the evening of January 14. Having eaten food at the hotel, she claims he told her he had to 'go comfort his friend' as his 'girlfriend had just committed suicide' and offered her to go with him. Miss Wright opted to stay at the hotel and fell asleep. She woke at 2am where she spotted a 'fraudulent activity' email in her inbox which said there had been a failed attempt to withdraw $1,318.68 from her Bank of America platinum credit card in Malaga.    She later found $445.06 had been withdrawn from her bank account. At this point she discovered her cards were missing and she says she messaged Abalimba to ask him where he was. He walked back through the door of their hotel room and she says told her he would need to fly back to Paris the next day with his friend and ushered her back to bed. Within five minutes Miss Wright says he fell asleep 'snoring' and, 'fearing something wasn't right', she crawled out of bed to check her bag where she discovered her cards had reappeared. Confused and scared, she looked at his phone to try and find out if he had attempted to use her cards - which is when she uncovered a photo of a passport which showed a picture of his face and the name 'Medi Abalimba'. She Googled his name where she finally discovered who he really was and his dark past. The terrified nurse contacted her friend in a panic and hurriedly got her stuff together, ran from the hotel barefooted and got in an Uber to the airport. 'I'm just thinking I'll buy a flight when I get to the airport because I'm scared and I just want to get out of here,' she said. Miss Wright had a nervous five hour wait for the next available flight to London Gatwick at 10am, fearing he would turn up at any moment. While sitting in the airport a message pinged up on her phone from Abalimba using another number asking her where she was, which she says she instantly deleted and blocked.  'It made me feel really scared, even my mum was checking in on me and asking me to send me this guy's picture,' Miss Wright said. 'I've never had that experience like this before but now... I haven't even told my mum what happened. 'Even though I know it's a once in a lifetime thing but it did kind of wake me up. 'The next time I have a gut feeling that something isn't right... and maybe I shouldn't go... I'll listen to that gut feeling. There was a bunch of red flags I should have just blocked this guy and never talk to him again. 'I think I was being too nice and giving him the benefit of the doubt.' Miss Wright claims Abalimba lied to her about his life in order to manipulate her. 'I think he's very good at manipulation and making it seem like he's a normal person - he dresses like a normal person and speaks like he has a normal life. 'I don't know, but it'll never happen again.' She briefly heard from him again when she set up an Instagram account to try and warn others about him, but she has since deleted the account.","She briefly heard from him again when she set up an Instagram account to try and warn others about him, but she has since deleted the account."
515,Fans think they know exactly what CR7 means by cryptic tweet: 'Who's counting?',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Fans-think-they-know-exactly-what-CR7-means-by-cryptic-tweet-Whos-counting/3302503,18 hours ago,"Fans believe they've cracked the code behind a cryptic Cristiano Ronaldo tweet - after he posted 'who's counting?' following yet another goal for Al-Nassr.  Ronaldo, 39, posted the mysterious tweet on Wednesday asking after scoring for Al-Nassr on Tuesday, and shared a photo of him celebrating. That was the 874th goal of his career and it secured Al-Nassr a 1-0 win away from home in the first leg of their Asian Champions League last 16 tie with Al Feiha. He debuted a new celebration to mark the goal, running to the corner flag, jumping, and putting his hands on his chest in a diversion from his trademark 'Siuuu' routine. 'Yeah this guy ain't retiring before he scores goal number 1000,' wrote one fan on X in response to his tweet.   '1000 goals, we will be there for the greatest achievement ever,' said one, adding a goat emoji to suggest he is the greatest of all time. '874 and still counting,' wrote another. '1000 Goals Loading,' said one. Ronaldo holds the official record for the most goals ever for club and country already, having netted 874 times during his career. He'd need a good few seasons under his belt to get to 1,000, however. He has scored 45 in 51 games at Al-Nassr - great going, but at that rate he'll take a while to accumulate the 126 still needed. Pele is credited with 1,279 goals by Guinness World Records, a total which includes friendlies, but it has fuelled debate. FIFA credits Pele with 1,381 goals in the same number of games, 1,363, proving how it can be difficult to count for more historical figures. Ronaldo's total of 874 so far puts him comfortably ahead of Lionel Messi, who has hit the net 821 times in his storied career.    Due to the Asian Cup, there has been no competitive action for Al-Nassr since December, and whilst there was a visit to China during his extended break, Ronaldo wasn't able to play. The injury left him cheering from the stands as Al-Nassr crushed Lionel Messi's Inter Miami 6-0. At the weekend, Ronaldo stormed off the pitch after watching Al-Hilal's Sergej Milinkovic-Savic win the MVP award at the Riyadh Cup final.   Al-Nassr lost the Riyadh Seasons Cup final 2-0, and Ronaldo launched his runners-up medal high into the stands at the end of the game. Before next week's return leg against Al Feiha, Al-Nassr host Al Fateh in a league game on Saturday night, their first Saudi Pro League game since December.","Before next week's return leg against Al Feiha, Al-Nassr host Al Fateh in a league game on Saturday night, their first Saudi Pro League game since December."

In a press release, the city revealed its intentions, âBeschizza responded favourably to the call from the Ãle-de-France Region and proposed the town of Aulnay-sous-Bois to host the future Paris Saint-Germain football stadium within the development project Val Francilia.â Continuing, the statement mentioned, âThis development project offers more than 50 hectares âready-to-useâ for the new stadium which will allow renewal of currently artificialised land.â In particular, the city points to an âindustrial wastelandâ that could be redeveloped into a new home for the club, whilst also highlighting their proximity to Paris. Situated just northeast of the capital, with close connections to two airports (Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Le Bourget) and a series of motorways which would help ease travel to their proposed site. This public proposition comes following the ongoing dispute with PSG and the City of Paris over the Parc des Princes. PSG want to redevelop the Parc increasing its capacity from 47,000 to 57,000 but are only willing to do so if they can become owners of the stadium. However, negotiations unravelled after a bitter war of words, with the town hall now refusing to sell the stadium, and the president of PSG, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, stating that the club will now leave their historic home.

After missing the first six months of the season with a series of injuries, the 18-year-old has made just one start against lower-league Arandina in the Copa del Rey.  Since returning to fitness at the start of January, Guler has seen just 89 minutes of game time in four matches, most of which came against Arandina. He was also seen launching his bib after warming up without getting on at the Santiago Bernabeu a couple of weeks ago. According to Sport, he will have options to leave on loan in the summer if he does not see himself getting more game time next year. They claim that Tottenham Hotspur and Bayer Leverkusen are both willing to offer Guler an exit route. Yet Los Blancos would be more happy loaning him to a side where he is guaranteed minutes, or Milan. Real Madrid were pleased with the experience they had loaning Brahim Diaz to the Rossoneri, having received a quality forward back who could make his way into the Spain squad. Ancelotti has been clear with Guler that he must be patient and wait for his chances, and it seems likely the situation will lend itself for that in the coming months. With Real Madrid reaching out ahead of their competition in La Liga, Ancelotti will be able to rotate ahead of European games, when Guler could see more minutes.","Ancelotti has been clear with Guler that he must be patient and wait for his chances, and it seems likely the situation will lend itself for that in the coming months.

The Round of 16 match in the AFC Champions League against Al-Fayha became Ronaldo's thousandth in his illustrious career. During this period, he managed to score 746 goals. In July 2002, Sporting's coach, Laszlo Boloni, impressed by Ronaldo's dribbling skills, invited him to participate in preseason training with the first team. And already in August, Cristiano made his debut in official matches for the club in the Champions League qualifiers against Inter Milan. Against Al-Fayha, Ronaldo scored in the 81st minute. The forward skillfully maneuvered past Marcelo Brozovic and, from the edge of the penalty area, struck past the opponent's goalkeeper with a single touch. This goal proved to be the only one in the match.","Against Al-Fayha, Ronaldo scored in the 81st minute.

521,Chilean Super Cup final suspended after fan violence causes FIRE in the stands,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chilean-Super-Cup-final-suspended-after-fan-violence-causes-FIRE-in-the-stands/3300775,12 Feb,"The Chilean Super Cup final was forced to be suspended after fan violence lead to a fire breaking out in the stands on Sunday evening.  Colo Colo and Huachipato were in the latter stages of their clash at the Estadio Nacional Julio MartÃ­nez PrÃ¡danos when fan groups caused the match to be halted. Supporters from the 'Garra Blanca' - an ultras group for Colo Colo - had been disruptive prior to kick-off, however, caused chaos after attempting to get on the pitch during the second-half. Chilean news outlet La Tercera report that the Garra Blanca 'invaded the athletics track' on the outer perimeter of the pitch, with the intention of making their way onto the field. As police battled with the supporters to keep them off the pitch, scenes at the stadium quickly turned ugly as flares and fireworks were then let off in the stands.   After around half an hour, the match was able to resume as police and other officials managed to subdue the supporters - but only temporarily. Shortly after the restart, the match was called off officially as unrest continued to grow and, eventually, a fire sparked out from within the stands. Footage showed the flames burning as supporters still stood in the stadium. After the match, former Barcelona and current Colo Colo star Arturo Vidal was quick to criticise the incident and insisted that safety 'measures' must be put in place. 'In other places there are other measures. We have to carefully analyze what happened,' Vidal said. The Chilean news outlet also reported that problem occurred almost immediately, as flares and fireworks were let off before a ball had even been kicked. They also claim that the minute's silence, which was held for the late former president SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era and victims of the fires in the ValparaÃ­so Region, were not respected. Then at half-time, according to DirectTV Sport, the Garra Blanca fans began rioting to a more extreme level and began to destroy seats and throw them on the pitch.   The second-half was delayed by an extra 15 minutes - on top of the allocated 15 minutes - before they then later tried to enter the pitch via the athletics track. Colo Colo had been winning the match 2-0 before officials opted to suspend it in 78th minute. Through a header in the 11th minute, Carlos Palacios made it 1-0 by connecting with a cross before Vidal converted from the penalty spot in the 22nd minute. It was the Chilean midfielder's first appearance for the club since resigning for them back in January.",It was the Chilean midfielder's first appearance for the club since resigning for them back in January.
522,Frankfurt boss apologises to Man United flop Donny van de Beek over Europa snub,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Frankfurt-boss-apologises-to-Man-United-flop-Donny-van-de-Beek-over-Europa-snub/3299304,11 Feb,"Eintracht Frankfurt boss Dino Toppmoller has apologised to Donny van de Beek for leaving him out their Europa Conference League squad and insisted he has '100 per cent confidence in the German midfielder'.  Van de Beek last month joined the Bundesliga giants until the end of the season after struggling for minutes under his former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old midfielder has struggled to settle at the club, having been substituted in each of his appearances for Frankfurt to date. Thing went from bad to worse for Van de Beek when Toppmoller decided to leave him out of Eintracht Frankfurt's Europa Conference League squad. Toppmoller has apologised to Van de Beek and says he has 'confidence' in the midfielder's 'quality' - stating the Dutchman will 'definitely help in the second half of the season'.  Toppmoller has also urged the Frankfurt to remain patient with Van de Beek due to the lack of football he had at Manchester United, claiming his success at the club 'won't happen overnight'. 'He's only played a total of four games in the last two years, so it won't happen overnight,' Toppmoller said. 'But I have 100 per cent confidence in his quality, he'll definitely help us in the second half of the season. I told Donny that I was sorry but also what I expected from him now.' Toppmoller went on to discuss how Van de Beek took the news, saying: 'He showed me that he can handle the decision well. He is ready to take on the challenge.' Van de Beek struggled to make an impression during his first three appearances for Frankfurt and was taken off at half-time during their victory over Mainz last month. As per UEFA regulations, clubs are only able to make three changes to their 25-man squads ahead of the knockout stages - and Van de Beek was the man to miss out. January arrivals Sasa Kalajdzic and Hugo Ekitike, as well as Philipp Max, were selected instead, leaving Van de Beek's future looking bleak just weeks into his stint. He is yet to score or assist in his three appearances for Frankfurt and found himself left on the substitutes' bench for the 2-0 defeat by Koln. Incredibly, he has created just one chance for his team-mates since joining the club - meaning he is not a priority for Toppmoller. Van de Beek was hoping for a fresh start at Eintracht Frankfurt after struggling for minutes at Manchester United following his arrival in 2020. Van de Beek made just 23 starts over three-and-a-half years under three different bosses, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Ten Hag.  Erik ten Hag, however, believes injuries were primarily to blame for Van de Beek's woes at Old Trafford. 'He has had many injuries, first of all,' Ten Hag said. 'From the first moment I came in here at Manchester United, he wasn't the player he was at Ajax as he was injured. 'So many times he was not available and then he struggled for a long time to recover from that injury. That is probably the main reason why he was not playing. 'We decided for a loan in the summer but it didn't come and then his opportunities are few because also we make appointments and we make agreements with players and contract players in that position. The competition was high.'",'We decided for a loan in the summer but it didn't come and then his opportunities are few because also we make appointments and we make agreements with players and contract players in that position.

523,Deja vu a strong possibility as Barcelona prepare to bounce back against Celta Vigo,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Deja-vu-a-strong-possibility-as-Barcelona-prepare-to-bounce-back-against-Celta-Vigo/3301864,1 day ago,"La Liga promises to throw up more spectacular action this weekend, and one of the matches that will be expressly focused on takes place at Balaidos, where Celta Vigo host an ailing Barcelona side.  While a Man City v Chelsea Live Stream will be popular across the world at 6.30pm CET on Saturday evening, taking place at the same time in Vigo will be Barcelonaâs match against Celta, which presents a good opportunity for Xavi Hernandezâs side to get back on the horse following a poor result against Granada last weekend. A 3-3 draw meant that the Catalans are now 10 points behind bitter rivals Real Madrid in the La Liga title race. Itâs highly improbable that they will be able to make this up, although all Barcelona can do is to continue picking up victories â something they had been doing until they faced Granada. The problem for Barcelona is that it could be very difficult to pick up three points at Balaidos. They may be coming up against a Celta team that is on poor form, having lost four of their last five matches across all competitions, but with the likes of Iago Aspas and Jorgen Strand Larsen, Rafa Benitezâs side can cause all sorts of problems to the Blaugranaâs defence, which has shipped 20 goals in their last eight matches. Barcelona have failed to win their last two visits to Vigo, draw 3-3 in November 2021 before losing 2-1 in the final game of last season. On that occasion, Gabri Veiga scored twice, and although he wonât be involved this weekend as he joined Al Ahli last summer, there are a few Celta players capable of stepping into that role, hence creating the possible situation of dÃ©jÃ  vu. However, while Celta can take advantage of Barcelonaâs defensive woes, the same situation can also occur at the other end of the pitch. Robert Lewandowski has hit form in 2024, while Lamine Yamal has been in spectacular form over the last few weeks. If he continues to play at that level on Saturday, the Catalans have a great chance of winning, especially as Vitor Roque will also be back from suspension. It promises to be a very interesting affair in Vigo on Saturday evening. If Barcelona want to keep their very slim chances of retaining the La Liga title alive, they need to put together a string of consecutive wins, and that needs to start now. However, Celta certainly wonât make it easy for that to happen.","It promises to be a very interesting affair in Vigo on Saturday evening.

The Athletic report that Carlos sustained a hamstring injury and will now undergo tests to determine its severity. The 30-year-old Brazilian has made 25 appearances in all competitions this season and has started ten of Villa's last 12 Premier League games. The setback is a huge blow for Unai Emery, with his side chasing a top-four spot in the Premier League and through to the last 16 in the Europa League. Ezri Konsa faces at least another four weeks after he sprained his knee in the 5-0 win over Sheffield United.  Boubacar Kamara has been ruled out for the rest of the season after rupturing knee ligaments during Villaâs defeat to Manchester United last Sunday. It could leave Villa boss Emery with just two fit senior centre-backs in Clement Lenglet and Pau Torres. The Spaniard could now return to the starting XI this weekend against Fulham this Saturday after recovering from an ankle problem. Villa lost Tyrone Mings to an ACL injury at the start of the season. Calum Chambers has only started one league game under Emery since he joined the club back in November 2022.

Kroos in the past has been critical of Saudi Arabia in the past, noting the lack of human rights and the treatment of people in the LGBTQ+ community. More recently he categorised Gabri Veigaâs move there as embarrassing, claiming that people only move to Saudi Arabia for money due to the low level of competition. Throughout the two matches he played against Atletico Madrid and Barcelona, he was whistled and booed by a largely partisan Real Madrid crowd for saying as much, and mocked them after the first of those games on social media. âFor me it was confirmation that what I had saidâ¦ I was right.â",âFor me it was confirmation that what I had saidâ¦ I was right.â
526,Inside Ratcliffe's United revolution: what it means for ETH's transfer war chest,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Inside-Ratcliffes-United-revolution-what-it-means-for-ETHs-transfer-war-chest/3302257,18 hours ago,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe turned to his friend at Nice's Allianz Riviera Stadium with a pained expression on his face. 'He's going to pass it backwards, isn't he?' he said.  Below, on the field, the wide player with the ball at his feet in the team he acquired in 2019, did just that. 'For f***'s sake,' Ratcliffe exclaimed. While the new, 25 per cent stakeholder in Manchester United is unlikely to demand Erik ten Hag bans Alejandro Garnacho from doing anything other than going forwards, those who know the petrochemicals billionaire believe the short exchange speaks volumes of his personality â and of what his fellow, long-suffering United fans can expect over the coming days, weeks, months and years. Ratcliffe is a man in a hurry. Not just because he is 71, although father time is a consideration, but because he wants to get things done quickly. Already, the view within Old Trafford is of an impatience, but of the right kind. A man and a group on the front foot who want to transform quickly.   Outside the club, some have raised eyebrows at the perceived value of the deal. Why would one of the country's most successful businessmen, who has made a career from making sound decisions, spend more than Â£1bn to take only a quarter stake in a club that has underperformed for a decade? According to those who know Ratcliffe well, there are two reasons. The first is that he is a 'proper' United fan. As a child, his father recounted tales of the Munich Air Disaster. From Failsworth, where Manchester meets Oldham in the east, he regularly travelled across the city to matches. In 1968, he was left devastated when his father watched the Busby Babes' healing European Cup win at Wembley â and could only get one ticket. After moving to Hull father and two sons tended to watch United at away matches in Yorkshire. Ratcliffe recalls desperately scrambling over a wall to get into Elland Road when United played rivals Leeds and the turnstiles had closed thanks to serious overcrowding. The second is that he already has the money and is not in this to make more, which may come as music to the ears of those scarred by close to two decades of dividend-paying, debt-servicing Glazernomics. Last year, United posted record revenues of Â£648m. To put that into context, INEOS' estimated turnover is around Â£59.3bn.   The aim, as it always is, is to win. While the deal is not expected to be formally signed off until next week, the speed of change and the amount of involvement has already taken those at Old Trafford aback. The view is that, despite only taking a quarter share, INEOS now 'have the keys'. There appears to have been a recognition in Florida that while United's commercial growth since their controversial 2005 takeover has been second-to-none, performance on the pitch â at least post Sir Alex Ferguson â has been far from it. There is said to be an acceptance that INEOS may well fare better, which would be in their own interest given they retain the majority share. Off-the-field, much attention has been paid to the stadium itself, suffering badly following years of neglect. In 2022, in a move some saw simply as an attempt to appease fans on the back of a leaking roof, the Glazers asked the renowned designers of Spurs' stadium, Populous, to come up with options. Three were presented. One was to redevelop, the second was to knock down and build next door while the third was to move elsewhere. That project is now in INEOS's hands and they are not wasting any time. Already there have been developments.    The third option has been discarded. While no decisions have been made, the second option is currently viewed as the most favourable, although fans will be heavily consulted. Spurs's sublime new manor, along with its single-tier, 17,500-capacity 'Kop' style stand behind a goal, may well be recreated on a larger scale as part of a 90,000, state-of-the-art venue. A 'new' Stretford End in a 'new' Old Trafford. Already, private investment partners at home and abroad are being sought. They are used to funding projects on a much bigger scale and they have the contacts book. It has already been reported that talks have taken place with local politicians with regards to government involvement, including mayor of Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. What can also be disclosed is that talks with the Football Association at some stage are likely over luring some England matches away from Wembley to what is hoped would become a Wembley of the North. The view is that such a redevelopment, which stretches from Old Trafford down to the water and links the area with MediaCity, would take around five years. If there is any way to speed that up, it will be found.   While nothing is set in stone, a 5 star-hotel and facilities to cater for those who travel to United from across the planet, who currently have a megastore and modest museum to entertain them on non-matchdays, is highly likely. Vast injections of cash and a huge rebuild on the field will not, however, be forthcoming. The early view from INEOS's period of observation is that a knock-it-down and start again is not needed. The group have been enthused by the performance of the team as a whole since their arrival was announced on Christmas Eve and particularly with the likes of Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund. The improvement shown by right-back Diogo Dalot has also caught the eye. There is an acceptance that certain areas of the squad need strengthening, particularly in attack and defence, and while the intention is to address those needs a vast summer spending spree is not on the cards. Investment in Carrington and a focus on continuing and improving United's famous academy conveyor-belt will also feature while the INEOS experience at Nice will also be drawn upon. There is a belief within the group that a number of mistakes were made following their arrival on the Cote d'Azur.   One of key principles of the INEOS 'compass', a series of values shared with staff on which the companies behaviours are based, is an ease with making errors â as long as they are learned from and not repeated. Interestingly, among 'Words We Don't Like' on the compass are 'lukewarm cappuccino', 'loose tongues' and 'quitters'. Since acquisition in 2019 there have already been five managers and a host of ups and downs. An appearance in the Coupe de France final in 2022, for example, was followed by exit at the hands of third-tier Le Puy Foot 43 the next. In a quest for Champions League football (which may well cause a headache should United pull off an unlikely qualification) they currently lie in second place in Ligue 1, top of a cluster of five clubs separated by four points. Nice are one of a wide range of sporting involvement for INEOS and Ratcliffe wants his stable to share its expertise. This is where sporting director Sir Dave Brailsford comes in. A visit from the All Blacks (INEOS are 'performance partner) to Carrington? It is not as far-fetched as it may seem.   When Eliud Kipchoge, from the INEOS-backed NN professional running group, broke the marathon world record and went sub two hours in 2019 he did so on the back of aerodynamic advice from those within INEOS's sailing (INEOS Britannia) and motor racing (Mercedes-AMG F1) ventures. In Nice, Kenyan running coaches have given players tips on pace explosions, and how to be quicker off the mark. When a manager introduced a system which had the wing-backs leading the charge they started picking up a certain type of muscle injury â common in rugby thanks to the stop-start nature of the sport â and medical experts from the All Blacks were brought in to assist in treatment and prevention. Kenyan marathon runners have also given talks to the New Zealanders on mental endurance. Brailsford is at the heart of this. He made a career on the back of his marginal gains philosophy, most notably at Team Sky and British Cycling, and one of those who visited the Manchester Velodrome HQ, later dubbed 'the gold medal factory', was Ferguson.   On a later trip to the United legend's house the pair were discussing how to ensure all within a team were committed to the common goal. Ferguson leant over and delivered a typically blunt line in his native Glaswegian tones. 'Dave,' he said. It's simple - just get rid of the c***s'. While it remains to be seen if that identification process has taken place, Carrington insiders say Brailsford has hurled himself into the task.  Already he has held a series of meetings with the various football departments, including players and coaches. He has also struck up a close bond with head of sports medicine Gary O'Driscoll. While highly-regarded O'Driscoll, who joined the club from September from Arsenal, was not an INEOS hire, the pair have been described as 'peas in a pod'. Some have wondered how useful Brailsford's marginal gains theory will be in the richest football league on the planet, where top clubs hurl millions at anything that can be seen to improve performance. Where analysts at various clubs undertake a daily battle for the best insights, information and advancements. The view, however, is that United have fallen behind in this area and that there is substantial room for improvement. While United fans may find it difficult to stomach, inspiration for such improvement comes from the noisy neighbours. Interestingly, Ratcliffe spent time with Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak during which the pair spoke about financial strategy in football, and how return could far outstrip investment. Al Mubarak estimated that City and their group of clubs were worth twice how much had been spent since the Abu Dhabi takeover in 2008.   Ironically, he could have played a role in Ratcliffe's arrival four miles to the west. When City won the treble last summer Ratcliffe sent Al Mubarak a congratulatory message, which was warmly received. While City and their supporters are basking in their status as the world's best, a re-ignition of the old rivalry, which has now lain dormant for a number of years thanks to United's struggles, may not be entirely unwelcome â especially if it were to lead the global Premier League narrative. While INEOS, are yet to have their stake officially rubber-stamped, the appointment of City's Omar Berrada as chief executive officer is indicative of that admiration and was effectively their hire. That move was indicative of two factors. The first being the speed of change since INEOS arrived and the second being a knowledge of the industry and of who is viewed as its key players and rising stars. It should come as no surprise that Newcastle United's Dan Ashworth â who carries a hefty reputation - is top of the list for the post of sporting director and, as Mail Sport reported on Thursday, and a move could happen within days following an expected approach â although there may well be a significant period of gardening leave as there was with Berrada.   Ashworth will lead recruitment in an area which most would agree has substantial room for improvement. That gardening period may sting a little given Ratcliffe's desire to get things moving. Friends say that while his hero on the field was Eric Cantona (who delivered a video message for his 70th birthday along with Ferguson and David Beckham), in business he looks to Warren Buffett, the US billionaire investor who shows little sign of slowing down at the age of 93. While Ratcliffe, who keeps himself fit and lean, may well seek to do similar, he is not going to take any chances. On the INEOS Compass, which features on the wall of the list at the company's non-descript Knightsbridge HQ, 'wafflers' are listed among the don'ts. The time for talking is almost over as Ratcliffe and his crew attempt to navigate United back to the top of world football.",The time for talking is almost over as Ratcliffe and his crew attempt to navigate United back to the top of world football.

Supporters werenât happy with another poor result and performance, and some decided to take it out on club president Joan Laporta.  According to details revealed by journalist Xavi Valls on TV3âs Onze programme (via Sport), a small group of fans gathered next to Laportaâs box after the full time whistle to reproach him on the teamâs performance and the future of the club, which led to a very tense moment. This group are said to have blamed Laporta âin a bad wayâ for Barcelonaâs recent poor results. This led to the 61-year-old becoming furious, and he proceeded to lash out on trays of canapes that were nearby. Valls notes that ânot one, not two, not three but all the ones in front of Laportaâ were thrown to the floor during his rage. The pressure is certainly building within Barcelona, and Laporta is taking his fair share of heat because of this. Itâs not a good moment for the club, and they need to get back on track as soon as possible.","The pressure is certainly building within Barcelona, and Laporta is taking his fair share of heat because of this.

These doubts are thought to be behind the delay in MbappÃ©âs final decision on his future club, with it being said that the contract offer provided by Real Madrid is notably lower than their previous offer in 2021, when Madrid offered a â¬130 million signing bonus and an annual wage of â¬26 million. Whilst, Paris Saint-Germain were said to have offered a variety of different options, consisting of long-term and short-term contracts for the forward in an attempt to convince him to stay. Despite the delay in the decision, PSG are said to be pessimistic about their chances of keeping MbappÃ© beyond this season and have resigned themselves to a future without the player. Les Parisiens would obviously be ecstatic if he chose to stay with his hometown club, but they have been planning for the worst-case scenario since last summer.","Despite the delay in the decision, PSG are said to be pessimistic about their chances of keeping MbappÃ© beyond this season and have resigned themselves to a future without the player. Les Parisiens would obviously be ecstatic if he chose to stay with his hometown club, but they have been planning for the worst-case scenario since last summer."

The Manchester City star's Â£100,000 motor was caught on camera breaking a 30mph limit last July. The next month, he was charged with failing to give information relating to the identification of the driver in Wythall, near Birmingham. If convicted of speeding, the 28-year-old faces a fine based on his Â£300,000 weekly wage and up to six Â­penalty points. The second offence also carries a fine and six points.  Grealish has a chequered driving history. He got a nine-month ban and an Â£82,000 fine after crashing his Range Rover into two parked vehicles in 2020. He was also charged with speeding after clocking almost 100mph on the M42 when he was with Aston Villa. He pleaded guilty to careless driving and was only allowed back in a car in September 2022. At the time of those offences, Grealish had six points on his licence from 2018 when caught speeding on the M42. His case is due to be heard by Worcestershire JPs on Thursday. His agent said the hearing was a âmix upâ and that his partner Sasha Attwood paid the fine at the time of the speeding offence.",His agent said the hearing was a âmix upâ and that his partner Sasha Attwood paid the fine at the time of the speeding offence.
531,"Thierry Henry's theory on real reason why Jurgen Klopp is leaving Liverpool - ""Good for him!""",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Thierry-Henrys-theory-on-real-reason-why-Jurgen-Klopp-is-leaving-Liverpool---Good-for-him/3301319,13 Feb,"Thierry Henry believes Jurgen Klopp is making the right decision by stepping down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season to preserve his sanity.  The former Arsenal striker thinks the demands on elite managers have become so great that the pressure is becoming too much. Klopp is currently the longest-serving Premier League manager, followed by Manchester City âs Pep Guardiola, but there are growing concerns that the continued increase in responsibilities is leading to burnout. And speaking in his role as a pundit for CBS Sports, Henry said: âPep was at Barcelona, took a sabbatical year. Klopp is at Liverpool, is stopping. Xavi is at Barcelona, he is also stopping. Three great clubs. âThatâs a dream job normally and they are stopping. That tells you a story. The pressure, everybody has a voice, social media and whatnot. It is tough to be a manager and no one cares about you. Youâre going to have to take care of yourself at one point. âI understand that itâs very nice for fans and everybody involved, journalists, but do not think only about yourself and thinking that the Premier League will miss Klopp, that Liverpool will miss Klopp. We know that, we know that is true. But he was missing his family, he was missing his own time, he was missing his sanity. So good for him. When I got the news, I was like: âGood for you.ââ Last week Tottenham Hotspurâs Ange Postecoglou said that he thinks clubs must provide âsupport servicesâ for managers because of the increased demands. The issue for many is the non-footballing tasks they must engage in - such as increased media commitments, sponsor engagements and an expectation that they are to act as de facto club spokespeople. Postecoglou is in his eighth club job but has never lasted beyond three years at any. He said: âOur priority is always going to be the team and producing results. I can see why a lot of clubs will say: âLetâs just protect our manager and sort of get him to focus on whatâs important, build things around him.â âYouâll see that more and more, for want of a better term, support services around a manager with the demands of the role. Iâve been doing it for 26 years at different levels but it is becoming even more consuming than you thought it would be than when I first started.â","âYouâll see that more and more, for want of a better term, support services around a manager with the demands of the role.

532,PLAYER RATINGS: Saka keeps his cool to net a brace and Rice returns,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/PLAYER-RATINGS-Saka-keeps-his-cool-to-net-a-brace-and-Rice-returns/3300036,12 Feb,"Arsenal kept pressure on league leaders Liverpool after thrashing West Ham 6-0.  Mikel Arteta's side went into the break 4-0 up with goals from William Saliba, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel and Leandro Trossard. Saka then netted again in the 53rd minute before Declan Rice haunted his former club with a long-range strike two minutes later. The win at the London Stadium ensures Arsenal remain within touching distance of Liverpool and Manchester City, who won their respective matches on Saturday. Mail Sport's Kathryn Batte gives her verdict on the players in her match ratings.  West Ham (4-2-3-1) Alphonse Areola - 4 (BOOKED) Gave his team an uphill task when he conceded a penalty and was caught on his heels for the third goal. A few decent saves kept the score down. Vladimir Coufal - 4 Kept Saka onside for the penalty decision and rarely managed to get forward. Kurt Zouma - 3 A day to forget for West Hamâs captain. His attempts to defend the fourth goal was enough to convince his manager his game was done at half-time. Nayef Aguerd - 3 Given a torrid afternoon by Trossard and was exposed by the pace and skill of Saka on multiple occasions.  Emerson - 5 Got forward in the early stages but was helpless to stop Saka from cutting in and terrorising his team-mates. Edson Alvarez â 3 (BOOKED) Found himself chasing shadows and was second to the ball on too many occasions. Hooked at half-time. Tomas Soucek - 4.5 Was run ragged by Arsenalâs midfield trio and failed to get a tackle in. Rarely got forward. Ben Johnson - 5 Looked lively at the start in an unfamiliar position but failed to make a meaningful contribution.  James Ward-Prowse - 5 Anonymous for much of the game and struggled to make an impact going forward. Mohammed Kudus â 6 (BOOKED) Did try to make things happen when he had the ball but often had no options to pass to. Jarrod Bowen - 6 Worked hard in the lone striker role but was feeding off scraps for the duration. Subs: Kalvin Phillips (for Alvarez 45) â 5 (BOOKED) Konstantinos Mavropanos (for Zouma 45) - 5 Aaron Cresswell (for Emerson 76) - 5  Arsenal (4-3-3): David Raya - 6 Had nothing to do for much of the afternoon but was alert when he needed to be. Ben White - 7 Not really tested by West Hamâs wingers. Grabbed an assist for the sixth goal. William Saliba - 7 Put his side ahead with a close-range header. Had little to do in defence. Gabriel - 7 Followed in his fellow centre backâs footsteps with a headed goal before half-time.  Jakub Kiwior - 7 Made a vital interception when West Ham were on top in the early stages. The only real piece of defending that was required. Martin Odegaard â 8.5 Ran the midfield with some sublime passing. Finished the game with two assists. Declan Rice - 9 Booed by his old fans but had the last laugh with two assists and a sensational strike to make it 6-0. An outstanding performance on his return to East London.  Kai Havertz - 7.5 Linked up well with his midfield team-mates and was neat and tidy in possession. Bukayo Saka - 8.5 Ran rings around the Hammers defence. Kept his cool to convert from the spot before a fine finish for his second. Leandro Trossard - 8.5 Involved in all of Arsenalâs best play and capped off a fantastic performance with a superb goal. Gabriel Martinelli - 7 Not the eye-catching display of his attacking team-mates but still caused problems and linked up well with Trossard.  SUBS: Reiss Nelson (for Saka 67) - 6 Eddie Nketiah (for Trossard 67) - 6 Mohamed Elneny (for Rice 67) - 6 Cedric Soares (for White 77) - 6 Ethan Nwaneri (for Martinelli 77) Referee: Paul Tierney â 7 Got the penalty decision and the other big calls correct. A good afternoon for the official.  Managers: David Moyes - 5 Will have been livid with some of his playersâ defending. Boos at half-time and full-time showed what the fans thought. Mikel Arteta - 8 A perfect day for the Arsenal boss, who got his tactics and gameplan spot on.","A perfect day for the Arsenal boss, who got his tactics and gameplan spot on."

Keylor Navas had deputised during this absence, but the Italian will be back in between the posts for Les Parisiens.

539,Barcelona could poach defender from Atletico Madrid this summer,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-could-poach-defender-from-Atletico-Madrid-this-summer/3301194,13 Feb,"Barcelona will undoubtedly be doing their shopping in the free agent market this summer, and could well be looking to bring a key player from one of their rivals. The best Atletico Madrid sides of recent years have all featured Mario Hermoso playing well, but he is out of contract this summer.  So far Los Rojiblancos have offered him a new deal on a lower wage than he is currently aware, but as of last month, his agents were looking for exit routes for Hermoso. He has been linked to Aston Villa and Serie A. Gerard Romero now says that the Blaugrana are also keeping tabs on him for the summer. He currently has little intention of signing at the current offer from Atletico, and at the age of 28, could be looking at his last big contract. Hermoso would certainly be a sensible signing for Barcelona if they are to sell a central defender this summer. He is capable of playing out from the back, playing left-back, and pushing into midfield from defence. However it is also true that his best football has come in a back three, where he has more defensive protection. While he can play at left-back, it is not a natureal role for him to get down the line, and should not be considered a Marcos Alonso replacement.","However it is also true that his best football has come in a back three, where he has more defensive protection.

Kylian Mbappe may well arrive from Paris Saint-Germain, where his contract is coming to an end, while they are also keen to sign Alphonso Davies as their new long-term left-back, although Bayern Munich intend to make that very difficult.  Also on the agenda for Real Madrid could be a new centre-back, one that would be a long-term partner to Eder Militao, as Nacho Fernandez, Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba are all in their thirties. Lilleâs Leny Yoro, regarded as one of the biggest talents in Europe right now, appears to be their top target, although the teenager is also wanted by Paris Saint-Germain. PSG are pushing to sign Yoro as soon as possible, and as per Sport, they have presented a significant take-it-or-leave-it proposal to Lille, which they are awaiting a response on. Club officials at the French champions are said to be frustrated by the situation, as Lille and Yoroâs representatives recently increased their demands. Real Madrid are taking a patient approach in their pursuit of Yoro. They recognise that PSG are their only realistic competition, so if they decide to walk away, the door would be wide open for Los Blancos to step through. They also believe that they can convince Yoro to join because of the pool of French players already at the club, which Mbappe could be added to this summer.","Real Madrid are taking a patient approach in their pursuit of Yoro.

As the start of the much-anticipated MLS 2024 season approaches, Inter Miami know they must fine-tune the last few details in order to get off to a positive start in both domestic and international tournaments, which will not be an easy task by any means; there are still plenty of aspects for Gerardo Martino and his coaching staff, as well as the players, to correct. However, fortunately for The Herons, there is still the friendly match against Newellâs Old Boys (Thursday, February 15, 7.30 p.m. ET/ 4.30 p.m. PT.), which will be special for Lionel Messi and for Tata Martino himself, as they will face the club they both support. While this last pre-season duel edges closer for Inter Miami, Lionel Messi returned to Florida and has chosen to spend his precious time off with his family, especially after the exhausting pre-season campaign that the saw team, over a short period of time, travel to El Salvador, Dallas, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Through his social networks, Messi shared a series of photographs with his wife Antonella and his sons Thiago, Mateo and Ciro, with whom he was able to spend a few quiet days before the team return to work after pre-season. These few days of rest have also been good for Leo Messi to fully recover from the muscle discomfort he suffered in Asia, which stirred the pot of controversy in Hong Kong due to his absence. The Argentinianâs focus levels will surely be back at 100% for the match against Newellâs and then start the MLS 2024 season against Real Salt Lake on February 21. Four days later, Inter Miami will visit LA Galaxy in Los Angeles, a match that will conclude the Heronsâ busy schedule in February and will give way to another busy month of March with 5 MLS games and 2 more in the Concacaf Champions Cup. The football, as they say, never stops.","Four days later, Inter Miami will visit LA Galaxy in Los Angeles, a match that will conclude the Heronsâ busy schedule in February and will give way to another busy month of March with 5 MLS games and 2 more in the Concacaf Champions Cup.

There is little clarity on who will be the next coach in Catalonia, nor what kind of profile they may have.  After it was reported last week that Porto manager Sergio Conceicao had fallen out of consideration, his rival at Sporting CP Ruben Amorim was put to Deco during an interview with Nascer do Sol. Sport carried his words. âNow, all hypotheses are on the table. But which Portuguese coach? How many are prepared to take charge of Barcelona, its weight and responsibility? Furthermore, this Barcelona, with all the difficulties that entails. I know that Ruben Amorim is doing a good job at Sporting and that he plays a similar style to Barcelona, but I think he has very little experience.â Amorim has spent the last four years at Sporting, where he has won a Portuguese league, three league cups and a supercup, after a brief spell at Braga. In recent years Barcelona have looked towards managers who have a link to the club from their playing days, but neither Xavi Hernandez nor Ronald Koeman have convinced on a regular basis, despite a Copa del Rey, La Liga title and a Spanish Supercup.","Amorim has spent the last four years at Sporting, where he has won a Portuguese league, three league cups and a supercup, after a brief spell at Braga.

545,Erik ten Hag urged to ditch six Man Utd targets and complete two alternative transfers,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Erik-ten-Hag-urged-to-ditch-six-Man-Utd-targets-and-complete-two-alternative-transfers/3301611,2 days ago,"Erik ten Hag has been urged to focus on signing Bayern Munich duo Joshua Kimmich and Alphonso Davies to help transform Manchester United.  Both Bayern stars are due to be out of contract in 2025, making them more attainable for the Red Devils this summer. United are already claimed to have drawn up a six-man shortlist ahead of the next transfer window, notably the first which will directly involve inco-ing part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. But ex-Red Devils striker Louis Saha would prefer his old club to target two alternative players in Kimmich and Davies. German midfielder Kimmich has been both Bayern and his country's linchpin for much of the last decade, while Canada international Davies is considered one of the world's best left-backs, boasting blistering speed. ""They are two extremely experienced players, especially Kimmich,"" Saha told Betfred. ""Kimmich would obviously be a great fit because he's one of the fittest players in Europe and is capable of running games and is very slick. He and Davies are both quality players, there's no doubting that."" The duo have already been linked with moves to Old Trafford due to their uncertain futures, although Barcelona are known admirers of Kimmich, while Real Madrid have been tipped to sign Davies. It's also been reported that like in the case of Mason Mount last summer, United are keen to snap up players who've entered the final 12 months of their deals and are facing pressure to be sold. Saha, however, has admitted that their plan might not prove to be a success. ""Going for players with one year remaining on their contract is a smart strategy, but sometimes it doesn't work out,"" the Frenchman, 45, explained. ""At this moment, Mason Mount hasn't been a success at Manchester United, so ultimately it's dependent on the character of the players, their suitability to the Premier League, the style of the team and many other factors. ""Other teams will be interested in these players if their contracts are running down, so it won't be easy for Manchester United to pull off any of these signings. If Manchester United are unable to offer these players Champions League next season, then that will be an advantage to certain other clubs looking to sign them."" Signing stars of Kimmich and Davies' calibre would be vastly different from the aforementioned six targets who've been identified by United. Those half a dozen include a number of young centre-backs, namely Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, Nice stalwart Jean-Clair Todibo, Leny Yoro of Lille and Benfica's Antonio Silva. Also shortlisted in attack is Wolves winger Pedro Neto as well as Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. Both players would command significant fees.

546,Carragher claims UCL qualification would put Ashworth in a 'difficult position',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Carragher-claims-UCL-qualification-would-put-Ashworth-in-a-difficult-position/3302794,9 hours ago,"Manchester United's incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth will be put in a 'difficult position' should Erik ten Hag's side sneak a Champions League spot, according to Jamie Carragher.  The Red Devils are now just six points off the top-four following their late 2-1 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday. Ashworth meanwhile is expected to make the move to Old Trafford, with Man United and his current club Newcastle expected to reach an agreement early next week. Though finishing inside the Champions League qualification spots would mark a remarkable turnaround for the Red Devils in what has been a frustrating season, Carragher believes that it would make it tough for Ashworth to replace Ten Hag. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, by Sky Bet, Carragher said: 'To decide if Erik ten Hag is the manager for next season. And I think with Ten Hag it's an interesting one because the better they do you obviously think that is better for United.   'But if United keep winning, the way they won on Sunday â that's not sustainable. If they almost get through and get a Champions League spot, I actually think that puts the ownership and Dan Ashworth in a difficult position because you can't win the league like that. 'I'm not talking like a six-week period. We've all been there where you nick a few results, but we are actually of two years in. 'Look, we've said it a million times about Erik ten Hag's style of play, it is what we are seeing now â I'm not sure you can win the biggest of trophies playing like that. 'I think [Dave] Brailsford will know that, and obviously Dan Ashworth, looking at the way Liverpool play, or City, or even Arsenal for be fair. My point being is you could get to the stage where Manchester United are finishing in the Champions League positions, let's say they finish 5th, it's very difficult to change a manager. 'But at the back of their heads, they'll be thinking â it'd be a tough one to change the manager. And if they had someone that could come in and implement the type of football that we see the top teams playing, that'd be the brave thing to do and probably the right thing to do.' Scott McTominay netted an 86th minute winner for the Red Devils to close the gap to Unai Emery's side to five points. Aston Villa's defeat though allowed Tottenham to jump them into fourth. It is not the first time that United have left it late this month, with Kobbie Mainoo netting a winner in the seventh minute of stoppage time to give them a 4-3 victory away at Wolves. Though results have improved in recent times, Carragher insists that United are still making the same mistakes during games.   He said:  'I felt in the Villa game, even though it was a great result, to go to Villa at win that, it's one of the toughest places to go, so it's a brilliant win. 'But I still felt when I was watching the game â I was still seeing things that I saw at Tottenham after, about the third game of the season. 'There was loads of space in midfield, people getting on the ball and just running at Manchester United's defence, that was happening at Tottenham four or five months ago.' Ten Hag's position as manager has come under question at times during what has been a difficult season for the Red Devils.

547,Swansea 0-4 Leeds: Leeds show a Dutch of class on road to leapfrog Southampton,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Swansea-0-4-Leeds-Leeds-show-a-Dutch-of-class-on-road-to-leapfrog-Southampton/3301561,2 days ago,"Ruthless Leeds went double Dutch to secure a magnificent seventh successive Championship triumph in Swansea and move into the second automatic promotion place.  Crysencio Summerville, with his 16th of the season, and former Swansea star Joel Piroe gave Leeds a flying start as they both scored in the opening 10 minutes of a one-sided affair that equalled Leedsâ biggest win of the season against promotin rivals Ipswich. Leeds lost striker Patrick Bamford in the warm-up and that meant Piroe started against the club he left last summer for a reported Â£12million. It didnât take long for him to show the home fans what they have been missing as Daniel Farkeâs visitors roared out of the blocks in Wales. First Summerville beat Carl Rushworth with a close-range shot that took a wicked deflection off Jay Fulton.   Fellow Dutchman Piroe then beat Rushworth to round off a sweeping move that saw him fire a fierce shot through the grasp of the home keeper. It evoked memories of the nightmare start Luke Williamsâ Swansea side had suffered against Southampton three weeks earlier. Then they were 2-0 down at home in 20 minutes and 3-1 behind by the break. New boss Williams had tasted his first Championship win since taking over at the beginning of last month in the 1-0 win at Hull City last weekend, yet his side could do nothing to stem the flow of Leeds attacks. Rushworth denied Piroe a second and also saved low down from Georgino Rutter but he was powerless to stop a third goal finally being scored on 36 minutes when Gnonto turned Ben Cabango inside out and scored with left-footed shot into the right corner.     Swansea at least pressed forward a bit more in the second half and Jamie Paterson had two chances, forcing a save from his first and then blasting over the top from six yards out with his second. Then came another blistering counter from Leeds as Gnonto once again showed off his speed and finishing skills to blast home his second goal of the night to make it 4-0 in the 72nd minute and send the away fans home elated.",Then came another blistering counter from Leeds as Gnonto once again showed off his speed and finishing skills to blast home his second goal of the night to make it 4-0 in the 72nd minute and send the away fans home elated.
548,Two factors playing part in lack of Kylian Mbappe green light for Real Madrid deal,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Two-factors-playing-part-in-lack-of-Kylian-Mbappe-green-light-for-Real-Madrid-deal/3301259,13 Feb,"Real Madrid continue to hang on the telephone for the green light from Kylian Mbappe, but thus far, nothing has been forthcoming from the French forward.  There were reports of various deadlines and important dates, with Real Madrid reportedly wanting a decision in January, while Paris Saint-Germain were keen to have the matter resolved before the Champions League returned. Both od those milestones have arrived, and there is little clarity on Mbappeâs future. On Monday it was reported that Mbappeâs entourage have doubts about his signing for Los Blancos, in part citing the major financial disparity between what he would earn at PSG and Real Madrid. Cadena SER confirm that news, saying that mother and agent Fayza Lamari has always been more keen on a renewal in Paris, seeing him there for at least a further year. Recently PSG CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi also announced that they would be playing their football in a new stadium too, which could be an exciting prospect for Mbappe to be the one to inaugurate it. During the week, 600 PSG fans also came to training to ask him to stay in Paris two. The Spanish outlet claim both are factors in his decision. It is impossible to know exactly how Mbappe is thinking, and it would not be unfair to think the delay may well be a tactical move to see how much higher the offers for Mbappe will go. Real Madrid seem to be at the point where it is a take it or leave it offer, but it would not be the first time they have bent over backwards for him.","It is impossible to know exactly how Mbappe is thinking, and it would not be unfair to think the delay may well be a tactical move to see how much higher the offers for Mbappe will go.

549,Rodrygo admits he would 'LOVE' Mbappe to join Real Madrid in the summer,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Rodrygo-admits-he-would-LOVE-Mbappe-to-join-Real-Madrid-in-the-summer/3299579,12 Feb,"Real Madrid star Rodrygo has admitted he would 'love' Kylian Mbappe to come to the club in the summer and labelled the Frenchman as 'one of the best in the world.'  It is reportedly believed that Mbappe has agreed to join the LaLiga leaders at the end of the season once his contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires and he becomes a free agent. PSG want to keep the superstar and tie him down to a new deal, but an exit to the Spanish capital is the most likely outcome. Rodrygo has now given his seal of approval on Mbappe making the move. In contrast to Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti who refused to answer a question about Mbappe following Saturday's crucial victory over title-competing Girona, Rodrygo have a glowing review of the World Cup winner. The Brazilian would likely have to compete with his French counterpart should he make the switch to the Santiago Bernabeu in the summer, although that doesn't appear to have discouraged his view.  'I would love for him to come here. I always want to play with the best players and he is one of the best in the world,' Rodrygo told AS. 'I would love to play with him, but I can't talk too much about him. He's a PSG player and I have to respect that'. Mbappe has scored 242 goals in 289 games for PSG but there have been suggestions that he wants a fresh challenge at Real.  The 25-year-old has been touted for a move to Madrid since he burst onto the scene as a youngster at Monaco. He eventually joined the Parisians in a Â£163million transfer in 2017, despite Madrid trying to compete for his signature at the time as well. Mbappe has thrived since then by winning numerous titles with PSG and guiding France to the World Cup in 2018 and another final four-years later that was lost to Argentina on penalties. However, the Champions League has evaded the star striker's grasp despite PSG's ambitions to become European champions and a move to Madrid is beckoning.","However, the Champions League has evaded the star striker's grasp despite PSG's ambitions to become European champions and a move to Madrid is beckoning."

The manager had steered Les Canaris away from the relegation zone at the end of last season, but by late November he was sacked after a run of four games without a win.  Nantes at this point were in 10th and results had generally been patchy with four wins, six losses, and three draws but there had been nothing to demonstrate that the club needed radical change. However, still, Aristouy was removed from his position and Jocelyn Gourvennec was brought in instead. Results have hardly improved since his departure with a record of three wins, six losses, and one draw in the ten games since Aristouy was sacked, and point to the previous managerâs frustrations with the situation. âThere was no urgency to make such a decision.â Aristouy expands on this, âWhen itâs November, weâre 10th and Iâm fired, I consider it an injusticeâ¦ I look at whatâs happening in other clubs. Such as with Patrick Viera (manager of RC Strasbourg Alsace) or RÃ©gis Le Bris (of FC Lorient), they benefited from the trust of their leaders.â He remains frustrated with what happened and still thinks about how the project he was in the early stages of overseeing could have developed. âI am convinced that we could have done great things. Iâd been there for seven years (as the u-19s and reserve team manager), they knew who I was, what I could give. And after a few months, they wouldnât let me continue. Honestly, there will always be bitterness about that.â","He remains frustrated with what happened and still thinks about how the project he was in the early stages of overseeing could have developed. âI am convinced that we could have done great things.

551,Fulham have a dilemma over 'pay-as-you-play' deal for Chelsea loanee Broja,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Fulham-have-a-dilemma-over-pay-as-you-play-deal-for-Chelsea-loanee-Broja/3300708,12 Feb,"On the one hand, Fulham are thrilled Rodrigo Muniz is suddenly scoring. On the other, they face a dilemma over what to do with Armando Broja, the striker who joined on loan from Chelsea on deadline day.  Fulhamâs agreement with Chelsea is unusual in that the more matches Broja starts, the less he will cost. Fulham are covering his wages whatever happens but Mail Sport understands they will not have to pay the full Â£4million fee if the Albanian (right), 22, starts 60 per cent of their games â a threshold which can only be met if he lines up in nine of their remaining 14 Premier League fixtures, after starting this win over Bournemouth on the bench. Described as a âpay-as-you-donât-playâ deal, Chelsea agreed to this abnormal set-up because they want Broja playing and scoring, so they can get close to their Â£50m valuation if they sell him in the summer. As a homegrown asset, he would represent pure profit. Yet Muniz, 22, is complicating this masterplan. The Brazilian, who signed for Fulham from Flamengo in 2021 and spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, had never scored in the Premier League.   Since Brojaâs signing, though, he has helped himself to three goals in a week. Not to mention the part he played in setting up Bobby De Cordova-Reidâs opener inside six minutes here. Muniz is making it difficult for Marco Silva to drop him with Aston Villa to follow at Craven Cottage on Saturday. Fulhamâs manager claimed he does not know the details of Brojaâs deal and insisted he will pick his team based on performances. If that is the case, Muniz should start against Villa. âI had a conversation with him (Broja) about the situation,â said Silva about the Chelsea loanee being a substitute for a second successive week. âWe believe in him. He knows that when you are in the Premier League, there is competition for places. âHe arrived a day before the Burnley game (on February 3). The striker who played (Muniz) scored an important goal. It doesnât matter if he is on a contract or if he is on loan. âFootball players are not stupid. They can understand decisions. One way to deal with the situation is to work hard and show they are better than the other.â",âFootball players are not stupid. They can understand decisions.

Argentina Under-23s head coach Mascherano was celebrating the team's qualification for the Olympics taking place in Paris this year when he invited Messi to join his squad. The pair share a close relationship having played together for both Barcelona and the Argentina senior side throughout their respective playing careers. They could now link-up again if Messi chooses to take his former team-mate up on his offer to be a part of Argentina's Olympic squad that beat reigning gold medallists Brazil 1-0 to qualify. 'Everyone already knows my relationship with Leo [Messi], the friendship I have,' Mascherano said.  'A player like him has the doors open to accompany us [at the Olympics], then it will obviously depend on him and his commitments.' Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, Messi, is yet to reveal whether he will join up with the nation's youngsters for the summer competition, but did post on social media following Sunday's victory over Brazil. The 36-year-old shared an image of Mascherano's youth squad celebrating their Olympic qualification with the caption: 'VAMOS!!!'. Messi's expansive trophy cabinet already boasts an Olympic gold medal after he guided the nation to glory in the 2008 edition of the Games in Beijing at just 21-years-old.   After beating Nigeria in the final that year, Messi labelled winning a gold medal as one of his most cherished prizes before winning the World Cup with Argentina in 2022. Argentina U23 midfielder who has played against Messi in the MLS also expressed his desire to have the experienced creative star join the squad at the Olympics. 'I hope he has the desire, that he can be there,' Atlanta United's Almada said. 'We have to see how he is at that time, it would be a dream that he would be able to play.'","'We have to see how he is at that time, it would be a dream that he would be able to play.'"

The Dutch international was linked with a possible move away from Barcelona last summer but he opted against an exit from Catalonia. Premier League giants Manchester United were openly looking to secure a deal for the former Ajax playmaker, but that did not materialise into a bid from Old Trafford. De Jong consistently stated his preference to stay at Barcelona despite the clubâs willingness to sell and bring in a â¬75m fee.  Fresh rumours have surfaced at the start of 2024, which indicate Barcelona will once again listen to offers, with de Jong more flexible this time around. As per the latest from FootballTransfers.com, de Jong has turned down any possible exit package, with a firm denial from his camp over a departure. De Jongâs current deal runs until 2026, with an offer to extend until 2029, but neither the player or Barcelona have made a firm move on a renewal.","De Jongâs current deal runs until 2026, with an offer to extend until 2029, but neither the player or Barcelona have made a firm move on a renewal."
554,8 times Real Madridâs Vinicius Junior was an inspiration to us all,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/8-times-Real-Madrid%E2%80%99s-Vinicius-Junior-was-an-inspiration-to-us-all/3300918,13 Feb,"Vinicius Junior is not only one of the most promising footballers on the planet plying his trade at Real Madrid, but is also a seriously inspirational human being in general.  Born in Sao Goncalo, Brazil, heâd made his first team debut for Flamengo at 16, and was being signed by Real in a Â£38m transfer which would activate on his 18th birthday just weeks later. It wasnât easy for him when he first moved over to Europe, but in the years since, the 22-year-old has blossomed into one of the most creative and explosive wingers on the planet. The sky is the limit for Vinicius in football, which makes it an even greater shame that the beautiful game he gives so much to is tainted by deep-routed racism, which he continues to be subjected to. But, in the face of adversity, Vinicius has always prevailed. Weâve recounted seven times he showed just how much of an inspiration he really is. To say that Yan Couto was given a torrid time by Vinicius in Gironaâs 4-0 defeat away to Real Madrid would be underselling it. Vinicius made mincemeat of his Brazil team-mate, directly beating him in the build-up to all four of Madridâs goals. Couto was in tears after the final whistle, having been given the runaround by Vinicius. The Madrid superstar sought him out and comforted him. Proper sportsmanship, that. âThe championship that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano and Messi today belongs to racists,â Vinicius wrote after another example of appalling racist abuse back in May. âIt wasnât the first time, nor the second, nor the third. Racism is normal in La Liga. The competition thinks itâs normal, the Federation does too and the opponents encourage it. A beautiful nation, which welcomed me and which I love, but which agreed to export the image of a racist country to the world. Iâm sorry for the Spaniards who donât agree, but today, in Brazil, Spain is known as a country of racists.â In a time where victims like Vincius are told to bite their tongue, the Brazilian spoke out, criticising those who donât do enough to expel such disgusting behaviour from the game. He later went on to criticise La Liga president Javier Tebas. âOnce again, instead of criticizing racists, the president of LaLiga appears on social media to attack me,â he wrote on Twitter, adding: âAs much as you talk and pretend not to read, the image of your championship is shaken. See the responses to your posts and have a surpriseâ¦ Omitting yourself only makes you equal to racists. Iâm not your friend to talk about racism. I want actions and punishments. Hashtag doesnât move me.â Vinicius launched an education app named âBASEâ in 2021 in his native Brazil, with the aim of improving literacy and making education more accessible for children in his country and the region he grew up in. In order to do so, he was the sole investor, putting in some $2 million. His non-profit charity also donated a further 10 mobile devices to the elementary school he attended in Sao Goncalo so that pupils had access to the app. The Vini Jr Institution was launched in 2021 and continues to raise money to improve education for children in schools in Brazil, where the funding does not allow access to full schooling and creates issues with literacy as a result. In 2022, celebrating the first anniversary of the institution with a gala in Rio de Janeiro, Vinicius told AS: âI always dreamed of this moment. I always dreamed of making my familyâs dreams come true, which is none other than to help those who need it as much as I did when i was younger. It has only been a year since we started our work at the Vinicius Jr. Institution, but we are already helping lots of people. âFor me, celebrating a year of my Institution and everything that we are doing is as important as scoring a goal in the Champions League final. It has been a very special season and now I am going for more.â Being racially abused in Spain unfortunately isnât a new problem for Vinicius. Earlier on in the 2022-23 season, Spanish agent Pedro Bravo said that Vinicius should âstop playing the monkeyâ after he celebrated a goal against Mallorca with one of his signature dances. The agent later apologised and tried to claim the comment was not racially charged and instead more to do with a lack of respect, but Vinicius wasnât having it. And rightfully so. On Twitter, he said: âAs long as the colour of the skin is more important than the brightness of the eyes, there will be war. âI have that phrase tattooed on my body. I have this thought permanently in my head. And I have attitudes in my life that turn this philosophy into reality. âThey say that happiness bothers. The happiness of a black Brazilian being successful in Europe bothers much more. âBut my will to win, my smile and the sparkle in my eyes are much bigger than that. Donât even try to imagine how much. âThey are dances to celebrate the cultural diversity of the world. Accept it! Respect it! Or freak outâ¦ In any case, I will not stop!â Endlessly inspirational. As early as 2018, Vinicius was taking part in charity football games. He played in Neymarâs âAmigos de Neymarâ charity match hosted in Brazil in 2018. And amid his incredibly busy football schedule and own charity commitments, he took time out in 2022 to play a part in another charity game hosted by Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos in Miami. A crowd pleaser and an incredibly selfless individual. Those new to football would watch Vinicius Junior and merely assume thatâs heâs always been a world beater, but that isnât the case. His mega-money move in 2018 was met with insane fanfare and media coverage, with the pressure immediately piled onto footballâs next big thing. Itâs very easy to cave under the pressure of being Brazilâs next superstar and the young up-and-comer that the biggest club in world football has just spent a record fee on, and many wanted him to. Vinicius started slow, but continued to plug away and is now comfortably one of the best players in the world, with an exceptional trophy cabinet. At just 22, heâs also scored the winning goal in a Champions League final. Mentality monster. Speaking after the launch of his education app with The Guardian in 2021, Vinicius also discussed the sportsmen who inspire him to push for change. âMy first concern was to help these young kids to achieve more via education. Football is a dream, but isnât it wonderful if we can help kids to get out of poverty by studying? My goal is to make it happen in the medium and long term,â He explained. âWe need more doctors, lawyers, engineers coming out of the favelas. We intend to give opportunities to them.â He continued: âIâve been inspired by what LeBron James, Lewis Hamilton and Marcus Rashford are doing. So I began doing something for my neighbourhood first, but who knows if it can grow across Brazil.â The trio have all made extraordinary humanitarian efforts of their own.",The trio have all made extraordinary humanitarian efforts of their own.

Midfielder Rice infamously joined Arsenal last summer in a staggering Â£105m move from West Ham and has cemented himself as an integral player under Mikel Arteta. However, Morris, who acted as Lampard's No 2 throughout his first stint in charge at Stamford Bridge between 2019 and 2021, has claimed Rice was also a Blues target. With N'Golo Kante suffering from persistent injury issues, Morris raised Rice's name with Lampard, sparking a brief pursuit that ultimately ended in failure. Speaking on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast with William Hill, Morris said: 'I messaged him when we were there and said, ""would you come back?"", because obviously, he was released from Chelsea as a 14-year-old.  'If you actually spoke to Dec, I don't think he thought he should have been released. There were quite a few of them that thought maybe he shouldn't have been released. 'It's probably the best thing for him. He's gone on to amazing things at West Ham. But while he was there, going into the second season I was on at Lamps all the time going, ""Dec would be unbelievable for us"". 'We need more legs because [N'Golo] Kante hadn't played for us a lot. He'd only played about 40 per cent of the time, he kept getting injured. And I said, ""would you like Dec?"", and Lamps said, ""I don't know, I haven't really seen enough of him"". 'About a month later, he was like I've been all over Dec since we've been having a closer look. I messaged Dec saying, ""would you come back"", otherwise there's no point Lamps going to have the conversations if Dec is still [not wanting to leave]. 'And he went, ""no, no, I'm a Chelsea fan, of course I would"". So that got put in motion and Lamps started speaking to him. And it was on.'   Morris even claimed West Ham would have accepted a bid of just Â£60m. 'It got put on the back burner in favour of a couple of other signings,' he said. 'It didn't end up going through, but at the time they were quoting around Â£60-65m, a steal for someone who could have easily been at the club for 10 years.' Rice was released by Chelsea in 2013 after seven years and later joined West Ham. There, he progressed through the ranks and eventually became the club's captain. Wearing the armband, Rice steered the Hammers to the UEFA Europa Conference League title in his final match, before Arsenal lodged an eye-watering bid. He has since made 32 appearances across all competitions at the Emirates.",He has since made 32 appearances across all competitions at the Emirates.

Perhaps none have been more surprising than Ukrianian goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.  When Thibaut Courtois was ruled out for most of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and Kepa Arrizabalaga was brought in on loan from Chelsea, it was presumed to be a given that the latter would occupy number one duties for the rest of the season. Yet an injury to Kepa in October gave Lunin a chance to display his quality, and since, Ancelotti has been rotating between the two since. Of late, Lunin appears to have won the job outright. As per Diario AS, Real Madrid are internally discussing a new deal for Lunin. The 25-year-old is out of contract in 2025, and they are hoping to be able to rely on him next season as competition for Thibaut Courtois. Equally if he does want to leave this summer, then a new deal would allow Los Blancos to up the asking price. Should Lunin depart, then Real Madrid will look for a low-cost option to replace him on the market, or alternatively promote promising 18-year-old Fran Gonzalez from their Castilla side. The continuity of Kepa has been discarded as an option.","Should Lunin depart, then Real Madrid will look for a low-cost option to replace him on the market, or alternatively promote promising 18-year-old Fran Gonzalez from their Castilla side.

557,Ferdinand lumps praise on Liverpool claiming he didn't expect Reds to be leading,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ferdinand-lumps-praise-on-Liverpool-claiming-he-didnt-expect-Reds-to-be-leading/3301537,2 days ago,"Rio Ferdinand has claimed that Liverpool have surpassed his expectations this season and hailed their manager Jurgen Klopp for guiding his team to the top of the Premier League.  Even after being without their top scorer Mohamed Salah since January 1, Liverpool have kept their foot on the gas to take a two-point lead on Manchester City at the top of the table. The Reds have done so by remarkably suffering only once in their last 17 games in the top-flight, with their 3-1 defeat by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium being their only loss. Speaking to TNT Sports, Ferdinand admitted that he hadn't thought the Merseyside club would be pushing for the top spot this season, but paid credit to their management and the recruitment they've done over the summer. 'I didnât expect Liverpool to be up there, doing what they're doing, top of the league,' the former Manchester United defender said.   'I thought theyâd be getting Champions League but I didnât think theyâd be pushing Man City again, I thought it was going to be Arsenal going toe-to-toe with Man City. 'But it shows you the recruitment theyâve done and the manager that Klopp is that they're back in it now.' Salah, meanwhile, has now been welcomed back to first-team training for the first time since he suffered a soft tissue injury while on international duty with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations. And Joleon Lescott also lauded the club for how well they've performed without their star man.  He added: 'The most impressive thing for me was how well they maintained their consistent form while Salah was gone. But I thought they would have dropped a few more points not looked as consistent but theyâve been a constant threat.' It comes after Klopp announced that he'd be leaving the club after nearly 10 years at Anfield. Much speculation has revolved over who could replace Klopp, who won a Premier League, a Champions League and an FA Cup during his time at Anfield. Xabi Alonso seems to be the front-runner to take over, with the former Liverpool midfielder having guided Bayer Leverkusen to the top of the Bundesliga, five points clear of Bayern Munich.    And Lescott offered his thoughts on the Spaniard's managerial style, claiming: 'His brand of football is exciting to watch. 'They [Liverpool] are going to have to get used to a different style. I think if they try to recruit a manager with the same style there would be too many comparisons. 'What Xabi Alonso is doing is exceptional [at Leverkusen] and heâs got an affiliation with the club so the connection will be there straight away. He would be a great appointment but he has to be successful with Leverkusen first.'",'What Xabi Alonso is doing is exceptional [at Leverkusen] and heâs got an affiliation with the club so the connection will be there straight away.

William Saliba opened the scoring, with Bukayo Saka netting a brace, while Gabriel, Leandro Trossard and former Hammer Declan Rice also found the net. The result sees Arsenal move two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool. Mail Sport's Isaan Khan brings you the moments that you may have missed from the game at London Stadium. Arsenal end West Ham hoodoo West Ham had been a bogey team for Arsenal of late. Their three meetings in 2023 resulted in two Hammers wins â 3-1 in the Carabao Cup and 2-0 in the Premier League this season â and a 2-2 draw in the last campaign. That was firmly put to bed in a blistering performance with David Moyes having now lost 23 of his 38 league games against the north London club. Heâs only lost more against Liverpool (24). In fact, the last time Arsenal scored six goals away from home in this competition was a 6-1 win at Everton in August 2009. The opposition manager then? Moyes. Yet, this time Artetaâs team were missing seven outfield players. Declan Rice answers West Ham critics Following his frosty reception at the London Stadium during the Gunnersâ Carabao Cup defeat in November, Declan Rice will have expected the boos and jeers. Notching two assists and a stunning goal outside the box is not a bad way to respond. It caused some home fans to walk back towards Stratford station at half-time â and those targeted chants about not signing for âa bigger clubâ were consequently rather quiet.  Kalvin Phillips shows his impressive mentality After spending many a month on the Manchester City bench, Kalvin Phillips does not have time to waste at West Ham if he is to make Englandâs Euro 2024 squad. A window into his mentality was seen at the interval. He was out doing ball work while most of his team were down the tunnel. A determined mindset.  King Promise shows his support for Kudus Mohammed Kudus has been integral for Moyes this season, scoring six goals in 18 league appearances. Against Arsenal his only real moment of joy was before kick-off, fellow Ghanaian, singer King Promise, in attendance as a special guest. His song Perfect Combi was blared out ahead of the match.  Smith Rowe's injury problems continue Emile Smith Roweâs rollercoaster career took another turn. The 23-year-old started in Arsenalâs 2-1 victory over Nottingham Forest and played well. It was only his second league start since May 2022 and touted as the needed kickstart after an injury-strewn year. But he missed this game due to yet another injury. The man cannot catch a break.  Ethan Nwaneri gets a chance to impress A sign of a flawless performance in the eyes of Arteta? Bringing on a teenager. He very rarely does so, as seen when he brought Ethan Nwaneri, Reuell Walters and Lino Sousa over to Eindhoven for a dead-rubber Champions League group game against PSV Eindhoven in December where none of them appeared. Nwaneri , 16, was substituted on in the 77th minute, his second senior appearance since becoming the leagueâs youngest player aged 15 years, 181 days against Brentford in September 2022. ",

The former Tottenham star has not made a first-team appearance in 11 months - which came during his loan at Besiktas - amid a string of injury problems. Last month, Dyche revealed that Alli would be sidelined yet again after needing groin surgery and now the Toffees boss has confirmed that any comeback is still a long way off. Regarding Alli's return date, Dyche said: 'We'll see. There's a long way to go. We've deliberately kept him back, we agreed with him to give him time and space. Hopefully he'll be back, we just don't know.' 'We've given him the privacy he needs at this time. He's in good shape. I spoke to him recently and we had a good long conversation with him.  'Making sense of another injury is difficult but he'll come through that.' Dyche had initially suggested that Alli had 'no timescale' on a potential return and that the 'early signs' were good. Speaking back in January, Dyche said: 'Unfortunately he has required surgery. There was a debate on whether to or not, which took time. Now he'll be recovering from that and there's no timescale. 'The early signs are good. We are just waiting to see how it develops.' Alli had an earlier groin operation last summer and also courageously spoke about his addiction battles off the pitch due to childhood trauma, which also delayed a comeback. The midfielder also revealed, in a New Year Instagram post, that he'd suffered a fresh set injury setback. Alli wrote on social media: 'As the year comes to an end, I just wanted to say thank you for the incredible support I've received over the last 12 months. 'This year has been a little different for me, I've learned and experienced a lot, had ups and downs, but throughout it all you've always shown me so much love.  'Unfortunately the year isn't ending as I would have hoped, I had been close to returning to full training but frustratingly I've had another setback with my injury. 'I'll be out again for [a] short while but my outlook and mentality is nothing but positive. 'I'll be attacking my physiotherapy and giving it everything to be back on the pitch as soon as possible. 'I hope you've had the year you wanted, and wishing you all nothing but the best for 2024.'","'I hope you've had the year you wanted, and wishing you all nothing but the best for 2024.'"
561,Xabi Alonso is the truth: He conquered Bayern and broke Thomas Mullerâs brain in the process,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Xabi-Alonso-is-the-truth-He-conquered-Bayern-and-broke-Thomas-Muller%E2%80%99s-brain-in-the-process/3300022,12 Feb,"This kind of result makes you sit up and take notice. Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 Bayern Munich. If it wasnât clear already, it is now; Xabi Alonso is European footballâs next great coach and it would be an act of lunacy for Liverpool to look anywhere else for Jurgen Kloppâs successor.  The win kept up Bayer Leverkusenâs unbeaten run in all competitions. Thirty-one games. Twenty-seven wins. Four draws. Theyâre now five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and still going great guns on all fronts. Not only is Alonso leading Leverkusen â a club that have never won the Bundesliga â to one of the greatest seasons in their history, but heâs masterminding one of the great campaigns from any team, anywhere. It was a flagship performance that will long be looked back on as one of the defining moments for this side. Not since Klopp himself was at Dortmund have Bayern had an opponent of this quality â not only the team, but the architect of their excellence. The comprehensive scoreline was representative of the chasm between the two sides. Leverkusen registered just 38% possession but were perfect with and without the ball. They limited Harry Kane, a striker on track to break Robert Lewandowskiâs Bundesliga record, to his quietest game. They registered eight shots on target to Bayernâs one and kept Thomas Tuchelâs side, the xG leaders of European football, to just 0.27xG. It brought to mind the time Kloppâs Dortmund went and beat Jose Mourinhoâs Real Madrid 4-1 over a decade ago. A statement of a changing of the guard. The future has arrived. Bayernâs wage bill and squad cost dwarfs Leverkusen, but here was a better-coached side bloodying their noses. This was no fluke. Leverkusen are a team built in Alonsoâs image, and he demonstrated that by explaining in great detail how they did it â how they pressed and how they dominated the game by controlling spaces across the pitch. ï»¿
âWe have controlled well the right moment when to press, when to wait, who could have the ball, who could not have the ball,â Alonso told ESPN FC pitchside reporter Archie Rhind-Tutt after the final whistle. âThe discipline they have, not being so dominant with the ball, but to be dominant without the ball. I think that we have done that. Without the ball we have been able to control the spaces, not to receive many chances, to wait for our chance, for sure the first goal was really important. âThe determination, the conviction of the press is what comes to mind first. I need to say thank you to them [the players] to push them, to help them, to keep going.â Leverkusenâs discipline, determination and conviction was rewarded in the final minute of injury time when Jeremie Frimpong put a well-deserved cherry on the icing, capitalising on Manuel Neuer going walkabout by beating his man and shooting into the empty net from range. It was opposite wingback Alejandro Grimaldo that had doubled Leverkusenâs lead early in the second half. The duo have now combined for an outrageous tally of 14 goals and 15 assists in the Bundesliga this season. Which is testament to Alonsoâs tactical acumen; devising a system that gets the very best out of his players. The two wingbacksâ colossal contribution to this team are reminiscent of Antonio Conteâs prime Chelsea, or Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson at their best for Liverpool. So comprehensively were Bayern beaten that club legend Thomas Muller, who only played the last half hour as they hopelessly chased the deficit, didnât hold back on his thoughts. Leverkusenâs masterclass made the 34-year-old look deep within his soul and ask himself what his team-mates were lacking in comparison. âThere are of course some symptoms on the pitch. To be honest, Iâm p**sed off,â the veteran Germany international told Sky Germany after the final whistle. âTo quote Oliver Kahn: What I miss from us players are the balls in the game. We are showing significantly better approaches in training. Itâs okay to feel pressure, but there needs to be energy and freedom. Thatâs missing in our game. âSometimes we have to speak about us players. Itâs not just about the coach. âWe have many international players at the highest level, we need to step up our game.â âSince Xabi Alonso started to make waves as a coach in Germany, people were thinking about the possibility that he would one day go to either Liverpool, Bayern or Real Madrid,â German football expert Rafael Honigstein told TNT Sports earlier this week. âWhat Kloppâs announcement has done is fast-track that discussion, it has opened the door to a job that Iâm sure he will be very tempted to take, especially with the background of Liverpool having stability. Whoever they bring in next might get the kind of longevity and run that Klopp has had. âI think that opportunity, that trainâ¦ it doesnât come along very often and I see Xabi Alonso jumping on it if and when Liverpool decide that he is the right man for it. I donât see how he can turn them down.â The answer for what Liverpool need to go and do this summer is blindingly obvious. Alonso is by a country mile the outstanding candidate for the job. Nailing his latest audition was just the latest proof. But such is his reputation that they might face real competition for his signature from his other former flames. This result heaps the pressure on Thomas Tuchel at Bayern. Real Madrid are flying and Carlo Ancelotti has just recently signed a new contract, but a Champions League exit would suddenly change the picture dramatically at the Bernabeu. Thereâs still lots of the race to run. But Alonso looks to have turned Bayer Neverkusen into bonafide winners. You look at the way his team dismantled Bayern and you question why Europeâs biggest clubs wouldnât be fighting tooth and nail to secure his services.",Thereâs still lots of the race to run.

The 23-year-old scored one, assisted two and also played a big role in Los Blancosâ other goal, as they moved five points clear at the top of the La Liga table.  It has been a stop-start season for Vinicius, who has had to deal with multiple injury problems. This has meant that he hasnât been on top form, although that has changed in recent weeks, and this performance was undoubtedly the best of the campaign. Viniciusâ future at Real Madrid has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, mainly due to the possibility of Kylian Mbappe arriving in the summer. The Brazilian made his feelings very clear on staying at Los Blancos when he spoke to the media on Sunday night, as per MD. âIâm always happy to be a Real Madrid player, very happy. I hope the president lets me play here for a very long time because I love this club.â If Vinicius continues to perform at the level he showed against Girona, Real Madrid would have no reason whatsoever to ever sell him, even if Mbappe comes â not that club officials realistically thought about selling him beforehand anyway.","If Vinicius continues to perform at the level he showed against Girona, Real Madrid would have no reason whatsoever to ever sell him, even if Mbappe comes â not that club officials realistically thought about selling him beforehand anyway."

Yet Napoli are also sweating on the fitness of star forward Victor Osimhen.  The Nigerian international made it all the way to the final with the Super Eagles, but were defeated 1-0 by Cote dâIvoire. However SkySport in Italy, as recorded by Sport, say that he has returned struggling for fitness. There is no certainty on how he will be by next week either. Osimhen lost 3-4kgs in weight over the course of the tournament, and despite finishing second, Nigeria returned home to a government greeting and plenty of activities. That came after an exhausting tournament, and was followed by a 16-hour flight. If Osimhen cannot go from the start, then it will likely be one of Giovanni Simeone or Giacomo Raspadori who comes into the side for him. Barcelona have beenn fragile defensively of late, and Osimhenâs power and pace are a major threat to a disorganised side.","If Osimhen cannot go from the start, then it will likely be one of Giovanni Simeone or Giacomo Raspadori who comes into the side for him.

566,"Club legends as managers: Di Matteo won Blues UCL, Arteta is thriving at Arsenal",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Club-legends-as-managers-Di-Matteo-won-Blues-UCL-Arteta-is-thriving-at-Arsenal/3302579,17 hours ago,"It can be difficult to resist the urge of a major club, let alone one where you have already carved your name into the hearts of fans and the annals of folklore alike.  Bayer Leverkusen manager and Liverpool legend Xabi Alonso is being touted as the man to replace Jurgen Klopp after the shock announcement of his departure from Anfield at the end of the season. The Spanish World Cup winner enjoyed a stellar spell at the Reds, helping them over the line in thrilling fashion to win their fifth Champions League title back in 2005, and duly earned his place in the pantheon of Liverpool greats as a result. Should he return to Anfield, he would not exactly be the first legend to return home to the dugout - over the years Premier League clubs have opted to hire club icons as managers, with very mixed results. Here, Mail Sport looks at six fan favourites who returned to manage in the Premier League and how their reigns went.   Kenny Dalglish is an all-time legend as both a player and manager at Liverpool. As the former, the Scottish striker made 515 appearances, scored 172 goals, and won six English league Championships, the FA Cup, four League Cups, three European Cups and a European Super Cup during his 13 years on Merseyside. He became a player-manager in 1985 and went on to win three First Divisions and two FA Cups before resigning in 1991. Dalglish returned to Liverpool after more than a decade away from management in January 2011, replacing Roy Hodgson, and oversaw an upturn in results and signed a three-year contract as manager at the end of the season. The next season he guided Liverpool to their first major trophy in six years, winning the EFL Cup in February 2012, and reached the FA Cup, but was sacked at the end of the season after finishing eighth, Liverpool's lowest Premier League finish since 1994.  Mikel Arteta spent five years at Arsenal as a player and captained the club to victory in the 2014 FA Cup final against Hull City, winning his first major honour in English football. Arteta was appointed club captain the same year and made 150 appearances and scored 16 goals for Arsenal before hanging up his boots. After his retirement in 2016, Arteta entered management and became an assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, before being duly appointed Arsenal manager in November 2019 replacing Unai Emery. Arteta led Arsenal to victory in the 2020 FA Cup and has implemented his philosophy at the club and guided Arsenal to an impressive second-place finish and Champions League qualification last term having led the league for most of the season. Arteta has a 59.62 per cent win-record in his 213 games as manager, the highest of any Arsenal manager who has taken charge of 50 or more games.  Di Matteo played for six seasons at Chelsea and scored crucial goals in three cup final victories, the 1997 and 2000 FA Cup finals, and the League Cup final in 1998. Di Matteo was head coach at Milton Keynes and West Brom before he was appointed Andres Villas Boas' assistant at Chelsea in June 2011. When Villas Boas was sacked in February 2012, Di Matteo became caretaker manager until the end of the season. The Italian formed a strong bond with the club's senior players who had felt underappreciated under Villas Boas and guided the team to a FA Cup victory and a highly improbable maiden Champions League win. Di Matteo was rewarded with a two-year-contract in June but was sacked in November 2012 after Chelsea failed to get out of their Champions League group.  Frank Lampard is one of Chelsea's greatest-ever players, making 648 appearances and scoring 211 goals during his 13 years at the club - winning 13 trophies and most famously captained Chelsea to victory in the 2012 Champions League final. After a successful season as head coach of Derby reaching the Championship play-off final, Lampard was appointed Chelsea manager in July 2019. In his first season at the helm, Lampard guided a young Blues side to a fourth-place finish and a FA Cup final. Lampard oversaw a string of expensive signings in the summer 2020, but Chelsea slipped to ninth in the table following a poor run of form when he was dismissed in January 2021. Lampard returned to Stamford Bridge in April 2023 as caretaker manager until the end of the season replacing Graham Potter, however,  Chelsea won only one of his 11 games in charge and finished in the bottom half for the first time since 1996.   Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played for Manchester United for 11 years, where he made 366 appearances and scored 126 goals. The Norwegian won 11 trophies with the Red Devils, famously scoring the winner in the 1999 Champions League final to seal the club's historic Treble. After managerial spells at Molde and Cardiff, Solskjaer was appointed caretaker manager for the rest of the season by Manchester United in December 2018 following the sacking of Jose Mourinho. Solskjaer led the side to an upturn in fortunes and was rewarded with a three-year contract in March 2019. The Norwegian continued to thrive at Old Trafford, leading United to third and second-place finishes in the next two seasons, and a Europa League final in 2021. He signed a three-year contract extension in July 2021, but a poor run of form saw him sacked in November 2021, and he has not managed since.   Alan Shearer spent 10 seasons at Newcastle, scoring 206 goals in 405 appearances and became the Premier League's record goalscorer with 260, having also netted for both Southampton and Blackburn Rovers. Despite having no managerial experience, Shearer was appointed interim manager of Newcastle in April 2009 whilst manager Joe Kinnear recovered from heart surgery. The legendary English striker was faced with a tough task to keep his side up against the odds.  However, he was unable to save Newcastle, and the Magpies fell to the Championship, with the club opting to appoint Chris Hughton as manager in the summer. Shearer, who is now a television pundit, won just one of his eight matches in charge - losing five and drawing two.","Shearer, who is now a television pundit, won just one of his eight matches in charge - losing five and drawing two."

Additionally, the Brazilian was linked to another model who claimed that he was going to be a father to a son, and even that he was the father of a 10-year-old boy. Yeah, less written about his sporting exploits since he swapped top flight European football for Saudi Arabia. These series of events have not been addressed by the Al Hilal player, although he did speak about some images that surfaced showing him looking completely different, more swollen, which the player later dismissed with another image demonstrating that he was in great shape. Despite not addressing the paternity rumours, the footballer has wanted to joke about this topic to share with his over 219 million Instagram followers some images of the new car he will now have in his garage. A vehicle he presented as his ânew child.â Judging by the features observed in the images posted by the Brazilian, it can be inferred from the shape of the hood that it is a Rolls Royce Ghost. A luxury sedan that is part of the second generation of the model, introduced in 2020, which has a more casual style than the rest of the models from the brand. Itâs a vehicle with all kinds of details in its interior, sophisticated, spacious, and with the particularity of opening its side doors like a book. A luxurious car that offers 571 horsepower and the ability to go from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.8 seconds, reaching a maximum speed of 250 km/h, which is electronically limited. This Rolls-Royce Ghost seems to be the latest indulgence of the Brazilian footballer, which has a price is just over $300,000, although you could add up to another $50,000, depending on the version, engine and spec chosen by him.","This Rolls-Royce Ghost seems to be the latest indulgence of the Brazilian footballer, which has a price is just over $300,000, although you could add up to another $50,000, depending on the version, engine and spec chosen by him."

Old Trafford is in need of significant investment, having been allowed to grow tired under the ownership of the Glazers. However, Sir Jim Ratcliffe is set to buy a 25 per cent stake in the club, with the deal expected to be ratified by the Premier League later this month. The Ineos chief is set to take full control of the sporting side of the business and he has already put aside funds to improve United's infrastructure. ""Sir Jim will provide a $300 million (Â£236m) fund intended to enable future investment into the club's infrastructure at Old Trafford, comprising $200 million (Â£157m) paid upon the closing of the transaction and a further $100 million (Â£78m) by the end of 2024,"" the club revealed in a statement back in December. Reports have claimed that Ratcliffe wants to turn Old Trafford into a 'Wembley of the North' and he has held several meetings with Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to discuss his plans for the club. ""The first thing I would just say is it's good to be able to have a conversation about the future and how we might support the club's ambitions,"" Burnham said in an interview with the Manchester Evening News. ""It's for them to decide what those ambitions are and what they want to do. And it's not for me to cut across those discussions in any way. What I can say, though, is it is for us to back the club in terms of its ambitions but also in terms of unlocking the power of the club in the city-region and beyond. ""We work with both clubs and we want the power of both clubs to be felt to the full extent in the east and west of the city-region. Conversations are ongoing. I don't think the club's made its decision yet, but whatever happens, we will back them whatever those decisions are."" The MEN add that United have been told that rebuilding Old Trafford would be the 'best option' as there would be major complications if they attempt to renovate the current stadium due to the railway line behind the stadium. The report notes that although a revamp would be 'more cost-efficient' than a rebuild, it would prove 'more time-consuming' and still cost a huge amount of money. A rebuild would also allow United to continue playing in front of capacity crowds while a new stadium is built next door to the existing one.","The report notes that although a revamp would be 'more cost-efficient' than a rebuild, it would prove 'more time-consuming' and still cost a huge amount of money.

The Champions League is the only competition where Els Blaugranes still have a chance of winning the title, but thereâs an aura of pessimism around the club after the teamâs last results and Xaviâs recent announcement stating he will leave the club once the season is over.

573,Petit criticizes Silva's wife for urging Pochettino firing without aiding anyone,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Petit-criticizes-Silvas-wife-for-urging-Pochettino-firing-without-aiding-anyone/3301800,2 days ago,"Former Chelsea star Emmanuel Petit is fuming with Thiago Silva's wife - Isabelle - after she called for Mauricio Pochettino to be sacked by insisting it was 'time for change'.  The Brazilian star's partner has regularly used her social media to outspokenly express her feelings regarding issues going on at Chelsea. Following a recent 4-2 defeat against Wolves, she took to social media to express displeasure at Chelsea's recent form as they slumped to their 10th league defeat of the season. Posting online at the time, she said: 'It's time to change. If you wait any longer it will be too late.' She later apologised for her post as Thiago was dropped for Chelsea's next match, an FA Cup fifth round win over Aston Villa.   However, despite her apology, Petit is still fuming at Belle's actions and insisted this is not the first time she has lashed out at club staff on social media. 'This is exactly what happens in modern football,' Petit told Betway. 'It could be his wife, his brother or someone close to the family. I totally disagree with it. It wasn't the first time his wife has spoken out and, to be honest, I was unhappy when I saw what she said because it was not the first time.' 'She did it with Tuchel and with so many other people. Everyone is allowed an opinion but if my wife did it, I would be in trouble in the dressing room with players, staff, management and owners the following day.  'I can understand that some fans are happy with what she has done but I'm not happy about it, I'm not happy at all. 'Again, everyone has the freedom to say what they feel but you have to be very careful, especially when you criticise the boss and take a dig at the manager in the public domain like this. 'I really, really don't appreciate it. What she has said doesn't help anyone,' he added. Pochettino later revealed after the issue that the matter had been resolved after the Blues centre-back came to talk to him personally.",Pochettino later revealed after the issue that the matter had been resolved after the Blues centre-back came to talk to him personally.
574,Trent Alexander-Arnold injury a concern for Jurgen Klopp after Liverpool victory,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Trent-Alexander-Arnold-injury-a-concern-for-Jurgen-Klopp-after-Liverpool-victory/3298836,11 Feb,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will anxiously await an update on the fitness of Trent Alexander-Arnold after the defender injured the same knee which sidelined him for three weeks in January. The 25-year-old, who set a new Premier League record of 58 assists by a defender with his corner for Diogo Jotaâs opener in the 3-1 victory over Burnley at Anfield, was taken off at half-time. âHis knee again? Yes, it felt like that. He got it stuck in the grass and we will see. We have (to send for) assessment,â said Klopp. âSame area in the knee. Nothing really bad, but he felt it again and we have to see, we have to assess it. âTrent said âitâs fineâ but itâs not fine (because) he feels it so we had to be careful and took him off and thatâs a double problem if you want: Trent is off and the other is we had no other right-backs available. âSo we told Curtis (Jones) what he had to do and we changed formation slightly and tried to make it as simple as possible for him, because it was first time in the life he has played the position (in the Premier League) and we didnât want him to be the inverted right-back and have to think about these things as well.â It may not be seen as such in the medium term but Alexander-Arnoldâs departure proved beneficial as his replacement Harvey Elliott provided the assists for Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez after Dara OâSheaâs headed equaliser on the stroke of half-time. âHarvey came on and did really well. All the other boys did well, scored 2-1 at the right moment to give the game the right direction,â added Klopp, whose side regained their two-point advantage at the top after Manchester Cityâs lunchtime win over Everton had briefly taken them to the summit for the first time since November. âWe scored the third and could have had more, itâs all good. Besides the Trent situation it is perfect.â Liverpool v Burnley â Premier League â Anfield  The match proved a test of both Liverpoolâs mental and physical capabilities after defeat to Arsenal last week as illness affecting Alisson Becker and Joe Gomez added them to an absentee list which already includes Mohamed Salah and Dominik Szoboszlai, while substitute Ryan Gravenberch was injured in the warm-up. âRyan, before the game, felt something. They told me he is fine but you cannot bring a player in who felt something when warming up so we had to act quickly and hopefully,â added Klopp, who said the game would have been like the âwild westâ with just seven players on the field had the proposed blue card and sin bin been in use. âA lot of the boys will be back before the next game because we need them obviously.â Liverpool v Burnley â Premier League â Anfield  While it was comfortable for Liverpool in the end it could have been different had David Fofana taken either or both of his one-on-one chances with Caoimhin Kelleher in the space of four second-half minutes with the score at 2-1. âIâve been to this place as a player quite a few times and we didnât have as many chances as we did today,â said Burnley boss Vincent Kompany. âYou need to put away your chances and we didnât do that.â",âYou need to put away your chances and we didnât do that.â
575,Hirving Lozano labelled âamateurâ by press after poor PSV performances,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hirving-Lozano-labelled-%E2%80%9Camateur%E2%80%9D-by-press-after-poor-PSV-performances/3301128,13 Feb,"The Mexican forward has been going through a rough patch of form, and he has not escaped press criticism.  Hirving Lozano returned to PSV for this season after his successful spell at Napoli. âChuckyâ returned to the team that saw him make a name for himself in Europe and was the most important signing of the Dutch side over the summer. However, his performances so far this season have not lived up to expectations and his form is already generating criticism in the Netherlands. As a club, things are going well for PSV and Lozano. The team lead the Eredivisie and have a 10-point advantage over Feyenoord, while the Champions League remains competitive as they are in the round of 16, where they will face Borussia Dortmund. The criticism lies at the individual level, as the Mexican has not had the expected impact on Peter Boszâs team. Kenneth Perez, a former player and now an analyst for ESPN in the Netherlands, harshly criticised the performance of the Mexican national team player. âPSV really have a lot of individual quality, except Lozano. I donât know what he is doing in the last four or five games. He looks like an amateur footballer. Itâs crazy because Iâm quite a fan of Lozano,â he said. His words are based on the fact that Lozano has stood out in recent matches, emphasising that he has individual quality: âHe is different from the others. He is professional. He stands out in exciting moments. I also expected something from him against Ajax, but I donât know what Iâve seen in the last few gamesâ he said. Across the current campaign, âChuckyâ has played 20 matches in all competitions: 13 in the Eredivisie, 2 Cup games and 5 Champions League appearances, among which he has scored 5 goals and managed 2 assists. Against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League, he has the chance to redeem himself and pick up the form that had PSV fans on the edge of their seats when his return was announced.","Across the current campaign, âChuckyâ has played 20 matches in all competitions: 13 in the Eredivisie, 2 Cup games and 5 Champions League appearances, among which he has scored 5 goals and managed 2 assists.

576,Newcastle eye summer move for in-form Bournemouth duo Kelly and Billing,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Newcastle-eye-summer-move-for-in-form-Bournemouth-duo-Kelly-and-Billing/3300049,12 Feb,"Newcastle United are weighing up a summer deal for Bournemouth defender Lloyd Kelly.  The 25-year old is out of contract at the end of this season and is emerging as one of the most sought-after free agents of the summer. Kelly has put in a string of strong performances for Andoni Iraola's side so far this season, and has been courted by clubs both domestically and abroad. AC Milan, Monaco and Stuttgart are among the clubs understood to have made proposals so far for Kelly who can play at left-back and centre back while there is further interest across Europe and in the Premier League. Liverpool and Tottenham were reportedly interested during the January window and could maintain that going into the summer.   Newcastle were hampered by financial restrictions in January but will be free to buy again from July and are also assessing the market to see what bargains are available. Kelly fits that profile and is well known by manager Eddie Howe from his time in charge at Bournemouth. An ankle ligament injury meant he only played nine times under Howe however Kelly has gone on to make 119 appearances for the Cherries, scoring two goals and registering seven assists. Howe considered a move for Kelly's teammate Philip Billing last month and that could come back into play also in the summer with Joelinton's wage demands likely to result in his exit from Newcastle. However Newcastle's current financial situation could force them to cash in on a number of high profile stars when they can. Billing looks an attractive replacement, and could cost Eddie Howe's side around Â£15m.  Indeed it was reported the Magpies recorded losses of Â£73.4m earlier this week when announcing their latest financial results. Should they qualify for Europe again this season, the club's financial situation would be greatly improved.","Should they qualify for Europe again this season, the club's financial situation would be greatly improved."

The France captain looks certain to complete a free transfer move to Real Madrid this summer as part of a long running saga. Los Blancos have remained calm on their objective to sign Mbappe in 2024 despite previously missing out on him. The situation has moved quickly in recent days with Mbappe reportedly telling PSG officials he wants to leave at the end of the campaign. PSG have made numerous attempts to change Mbappeâs mind with his current deal including an extension option until 2025.  Real Madridâs slow approach is partly dictated by Mbappeâs U-turn on their offer in 2022,Â  but that is not the case this time, with an agreement close. As per transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Mbappe has informed PSG he does not want to receive another contract proposal, as he remains focused on leaving.

The former England star is usually the one analysing the Premier League matches, but confirmed his absence for Saturday's programme on X. He wrote: 'Some good news for some: I've been silencedâ¦ with a rotten cold that seems to be lasting forever.' 'Hate missing @BBCMOTD but I'll be watching'. While there was no initial replacement named, BBC lined up with Mark Chapman in the hotseat.   Chapman is more than capable of stepping into Lineker's role, having hosted Match of the Day 2 on a Sunday night for over a decade. Alongside this, the 50-year-old works for Sky Sports and has hosted a multitude of sporting events. Chapman has stepped in for Lineker before, most notably when the former England international fell out with the BBC. This came as the corporation's social media guidelines for presenters were rewritten after Lineker sparked a backlash by comparing the government's rhetoric on immigration to Nazi Germany. In December, the former footballer was accused of breaching the new guidelines - including by the BBC's incoming chairman - after a series of tweets targeting Tory MPs. However, he denied this. Chapman stepped in before Lineker's dispute with the BBC was resolved after a series of talks and Match of the Day has been as strong as ever since Lineker's return.",Chapman stepped in before Lineker's dispute with the BBC was resolved after a series of talks and Match of the Day has been as strong as ever since Lineker's return.

The 69th edition of Europeâs premier club competition, the 32nd since it was renamed the Champions League is edging ever closer to the grand finale. The group stage, 32 teams split into eight groups of four which completed at the end of the year, provided us with the fixtures in the round of 16, which gets underway on Tuesday 13 February. This, as you may know, is the last time that the tournament is being played in its current format. Back in July 2023, UEFA announced a new, expanded competition which will feature 36 teams starting from the 2024/25 season. Before we look too far ahead, letâs stay focused on the here and now. The 2023/24 final will be held at Wembley, in London on Saturday 1 June 2024. The historic English ground has held a grand total of seven European Cup/Champions League finals - five of those at the original stadium and the two most recent (2011 and 2013) at the rebuilt venue, which opened in 2007. UEFA announced the various locations back in 2021. Wembley had originally been slated to host the 2023 final but due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final during the Covid-19 pandemic, all of the final hosts were shifted back a year. That meant that last yearâs final between Manchester City and Inter Milan was played at AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul with London instead readied to host the 2024 final. It will be the ninth time that the nation of England has hosted the final - the 2003 final between AC Milan and Juventus was held at Old Trafford in Manchester, home of The Red Devils.","It will be the ninth time that the nation of England has hosted the final - the 2003 final between AC Milan and Juventus was held at Old Trafford in Manchester, home of The Red Devils."

The two clubs meet in the first-leg of their Champions League round 16 tie tomorrow night. Giordano told Radiosei: ""With the Lazio shirt, I missed the chance to play matches of this level, like the one tomorrow against Bayern Munich. Mine was a poor club from an economic point of view, it would have been wonderful to have been able to do it but it wasn't possible. ""I hold on to what was and what I did. In my years at Lazio, matches there have been few of great depth, we lived through years in which we were always fighting for a comfortable ranking. ""With Vinicio we went to the UEFA Cup, that was the best. I have consistently followed Bayern Munich lately, watching them play I noticed elements of vulnerability. From a gaming point of view they are in difficulty, seeing them second in the standings, five points behind first has an effect. ""In the last 4-5 games, even when they won they had difficulties. Maybe they made a mistake in their winter preparation, now they seem on their feet.

581,Strasbourg captain criticises BlueCoâs transfer dealings,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Strasbourg-captain-criticises-BlueCo%E2%80%99s-transfer-dealings/3299314,11 Feb,"RC Strasbourg Alsace captain FrÃ©dÃ©ric Guilbert (29) has criticised BlueCoâs transfer dealings after Les Alsaciens didnât significantly strengthen in the January transfer window.  Guilbert inherited the captainâs armband at Strasbourg following Matz Selsâ (31) deadline day departure to Nottingham Forest. In the words of president Marc Keller, the Belgian international was a âclub legendâ at Strasbourg, and his departure drew the ire of the clubâs faithful, who have been repeatedly critical of the youth-centric approach, heralded by the arrival of BlueCo in the summer. Andrey Santos was the only significant arrival in January. The midfielder arrived on a straight loan from another BlueCo club, Chelsea, however, he is currently away on international duty with Brazil. Santos will return later in February, but will only play a maximum of 13 games for Les Alsaciens. Strasbourg succumbed to a 3-1 defeat against RC Lens on Saturday, and speaking to Prime Video Sport post-match, captain Guilbert attributed, at least in part, the defeat to a lack of squad depth. âWe are being slowed down by injuries. We didnât bring in any reinforcements this winter so weâre maybe a bit short on the bench. You can see that and that perhaps makes the difference and thatâs maybe why we didnât come away with a draw,â said Guilbert, who has inherited the armband following Selsâ departure. BlueCo have become used to being criticised by Strasbourgâs fans, who have been vocal in their opposition even before the American consortiumâs purchase of the Ligue 1 club became official. However, having their transfer strategy called into question by RCSAâs players is a novel and certainly unpleasant experience for Todd Boehly and co.","BlueCo have become used to being criticised by Strasbourgâs fans, who have been vocal in their opposition even before the American consortiumâs purchase of the Ligue 1 club became official.

582,The statistics that show Carlo Ancelotti that he could be forced into uncomfortable situation at Real Madrid,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/The-statistics-that-show-Carlo-Ancelotti-that-he-could-be-forced-into-uncomfortable-situation-at-Real-Madrid/3301818,2 days ago,"A big problem that Carlo Ancelotti has had to deal with this season has been injuries. Real Madrid have been plagued by regular setbacks over the course of the campaign, and especially in central defence.  Eder Militao has been out since last summer after tearing his ACL, and he wonât return for another month at least, with David Alaba also absent for the remainder of the season after suffering the same injury back in December. That has left Antonio Rudiger and Nacho Fernandez as Los Blancosâ only centre-backs, and even they have had injury woes. Rudiger has been out for the last two weeks with a thigh injury, while Nacho also missed the victory over Girona last weekend. That forced Ancelotti into playing Aurelien Tchouameni and Dani Carvajal as centre-backs, which worked as they were both excellent against the Catalan high-flyers. In the case of Tchouameni, he has filled in at centre-back on multiple occasions this season, and each time he has impressed. Marca note that Real Madrid have not conceded in 396 minutes when he has played in a deeper role, which included Tuesday nightâs victory over RB Leipzig. Itâs become clear of late that Tchouameni has performed much better than Nacho at centre-back, and with Rudiger coming back soon, Ancelotti would probably be better served partnering the French and German together, which Nacho being relegated to the bench. However, given that Tchouameni doesnât want to continually play in defence, it could mean that an uncomfortable situation arises at Real Madrid.","Itâs become clear of late that Tchouameni has performed much better than Nacho at centre-back, and with Rudiger coming back soon, Ancelotti would probably be better served partnering the French and German together, which Nacho being relegated to the bench.

McTominay was sent on in place of Marcus Rashford in the second half at Villa Park and four minutes from time he delivered the knockout blow by heading in Dalot's brilliant cross. It marked McTominay's seventh goal of the season and his fourth off the bench. His insatiable appetite to be the matchwinner, whether he starts or comes off the bench, is something team-mates can learn from, claims Dalot. 'I think every time he comes on the pitch, he has that mentality of trying to score goals and trying to help the team,' Dalot said.  'We need this type of mentality at this club, and I think he is the perfect person to show this season that even coming from the bench, he always has a good impact.' McTominay himself said he doesn't take being benched 'personally', having not started in the Premier League since defeat at West Ham on December 23. He looked to be heading for the exit in the summer, with West Ham among the suitors, but he has reinvented himself in a more attacking cameo role. 'There are not many players who can come from the bench and bring this energy and contribute to the team,' boss Erik ten Hag said. 'Scott is an example for many other players, always giving the spirit and always doing the right things. He is ready for one minute or for minute 90, he is always ready. It is great to have such a player.'   Victory saw United close the gap on fifth-placed Aston Villa to just five points and with all the momentum they are now being backed to finish inside the top four. But for Dalot, there is little interest in a 'favourites' tag for the top four in early February. 'I think it is a really important win,' the Portuguese full-back added. 'We knew that today was like a final for us; pretty much every game will be for us now if we want to get top four. 'We prepared well, and I am very happy with the way we performed and how we fought until the end to get the win.'","'We prepared well, and I am very happy with the way we performed and how we fought until the end to get the win.'"

Following the news that Kylian Mbappe has decided to leave Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent at the end of the season, Los Blancos are poised to secure the long-awaited arrival of the 24-year-old French forward. However, he may not be the only world class player to arrive, as they are also pursuing a deal for Alphonso Davies.  Real Madrid view Davies as their first-choice target to reinforce the left-back position in Carlo Ancelottiâs squad. The Canadian international would hold down the position for many years to come, and would be the latest piece of the puzzle in establishing the side as one of, if not the best team in the world. Daviesâ contract at Bayern Munich is set to expire in 2025, and if he doesnât sign a renewal before the end of the season, the expectation is that he will be available on a cut-price deal in the summer. Relevo have now reported that Real Madrid have agreed personal terms with Davies, bringing a possible signing one step closer. Interestingly, itâs noted that even if Davies does arrive, Ancelotti wants to retain his current first-choice left-back, that being Ferland Mendy. Thatâs despite reports that Real Madrid officials intend to sell the 28-year-old in the event that Davies signs, especially as he only has a year left on his own contract. If Davies joins, Real Madrid would have him, Mendy and Fran Garcia as left-back options, which would be overkill. A solution will need to be found in the event that this occurs, although for now, the clubâs focus will be on ensuring that Davies ends up in the famous white jersey from next season onwards.","If Davies joins, Real Madrid would have him, Mendy and Fran Garcia as left-back options, which would be overkill.

Gundogan, previously Sara Arfaoui, started dating former Man City star Ilkay Gundogan in 2021 before they tied the knot a year later. They have one son together, Kais, who was born in March 2023. Sara is one of the stars of Prime Video's new series Married To The Game which follows the lives of five football WAGS, aiming to give an insight into the reality of dating a top-level footballer. Sara was a highly-successful TV presenter and model before meeting Ilkay, with the couple relocating to Barcelona this summer after the midfielder joined the Catalan giants upon the expiry of his contract at the Etihad. He enjoyed a hugely decorated seven-year spell with City, winning 14 trophies, which included captaining Pep Guardiola's side to a historic Treble last season.  However, things were sometimes tricky off the pitch, with Sara infamously criticising Manchester on occasions, which included one rant about the quality of the food in October 2022. She posted on her Instagram story: 'Sorry, I'm sad to be honest but nothing. I tried [sic] so bad to find a good restaurant but horrible food everywhere. 'Can't find a real Italian or good sushi or just fresh foodâ¦ everything frozen. Restaurants here are focus [sic] on making money with drinks and shot [sic] like nightclubs, not quality food. Maybe in London but in Manchester nothing. I'm sorry.' However, speaking exclusively to Mail Sport, Sara revealed that she grew to love Manchester and actually found it hard to leave in the summer. 'When I was in Manchester, my whole life was (originally) around football,' she said. 'My friends were football, the people I met through my husband, and then I didn't have anything that was just my world outside of that. 'And I'm a social person. So it took me a bit of time, but I made it friends and it was really nice.   'After making friends, I was really happy. I had my own life and routine in Manchester and I have one of my best friends there.' There were several rumours about Ilkay's future in the summer, with the midfielder linked with clubs across the globe, while there was also a chance he would stay at City. And Sara went onto explain the difficulty of leaving Manchester behind after finding out her husband would be moving abroad. She added: 'Over the years I would see friends moving so it's something that's always around in football and you would suddenly just have a phone call from them telling you they're going to another country. 'So, it's always around, it's always happening but I didn't imagine that it would be us and when it's you it's big a shock. 'It's always sad, especially because you make friends, you're happy somewhere, you build your life and then you have to leave all the people you love.'  Sara also reflected on her initial struggles in Manchester and explained how sticking with things ultimately paid off.

The Durham official had previously refereed high-profile events including the Euro 2016 final, as well as Champions League and FA Cup finals.

We have professional referees in the country that I am leaving, which has been a big positive. âOne thing Iâd like to do is work with the refereeing team and the president to make this happen so that it will be successful for many, many years to come.â The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), who provide and train officials for the Premier League, English Football League and Football Association, paid tribute to Clattenburg. The PGMOL said: âMark is a talented referee, he has been a great asset to the English game and hopefully an inspiration to those who want to get into refereeing at the grass roots of the game.  âWe understand this is an exciting opportunity for Mark as well as further underlining what high esteem English match officials are held throughout the world game.â Clattenburg held the role for 18 months before returning to refereeing with a move to China in the Chinese Super League. He was later appointed president of the Egyptian Referees Committee, but resigned in January 2023 after just five months in the role.","He was later appointed president of the Egyptian Referees Committee, but resigned in January 2023 after just five months in the role."

However, De Rossi insists they ran the Nerazzurri close. âWe need to play football and there are many positive responses from this game, but also responses that show we can never lower our intensity if we want to fight it out with these great opponents,"" De Rossi told DAZN. âI think the game was substantially very even, there were moments where either team had the upper hand. I am proud of the lads, they gave their all and the crowd realised it too. When they recognise you put the effort in, they let you know, they don't do it as a favour. âI am also not saying I am proud of these lads because they are underdogs or anything. I am proud because they put in a great performance against a very strong team. I believe we are on the right track. âIt's too easy to look only at the negative incidents and blame a single player. Incidents change a game, but we win them together and we lose them together. âAll 11 players and myself too lowered the level of intensity in the second half and were made to pay for it. We did it too against Verona and Salernitana, but won anyway because we have a superior squad to them. We cannot afford to do it against Inter. âI didn't like the blame game that the media plays when I was a player and I like it even less now as a coach. If Roma played so well, it was down to everyone and if we lost, it means we were all below Inter's level â but not by much.""","âI didn't like the blame game that the media plays when I was a player and I like it even less now as a coach.

592,"Ashworth earned Â£200m at Brighton from just Mac Allister, Caicedo, and Cucurella",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ashworth-earned-%C2%A3200m-at-Brighton-from-just-Mac-Allister-Caicedo-and-Cucurella/3301820,2 days ago,"Manchester United have reportedly made Dan Ashworth their No 1 target in the search for a new sporting director.  Ashworth, 52, currently performs the same role at Newcastle United but it appears Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have identified the man they want to oversee recruitment at Old Trafford. The Athletic reported that although no formal approach has yet been made, talks could progress rapidly if Man United's interest solidified. Ashworth comes with a strong reputation for identifying talented players form his work at Brighton and then Newcastle in the past five years. We take a close look at each of their signings under his leadership and whether they worked out.  BRIGHTON AND HOVE ALBION After leaving his post as the Football Association's director of elite development, Ashworth began a technical director role at Brighton in Spring 2019. 2019-20 SEASON Alexis Mac Allister - A superb success story for Brighton's scouting network after the midfielder was signed from Argentinos Juniors in his homeland. After two loan spells, Mac Allister quickly established himself a fundamental part of Brighton's team and they made a handsome profit when the World Cup winner was sold to Liverpool for Â£55million last summer. HIT Leandro Trossard - An astute signing from Genk in Belgium who impressed over the course of three seasons at the Amex, scoring 25 goals and supplying 14 assists. Didn't leave on the best of terms after falling out with Roberto De Zerbi as he joined Arsenal for Â£27m. HIT Adam Webster - Brighton broke their transfer record to buy Â£20m Webster from Championship side Bristol City in 2019. Wasted no time in establishing himself at the heart of Brighton's defence and was rewarded with a bumper five-year contract when Ben White left for Arsenal in 2021. Has fallen out of favour with De Zerbi this season. HIT   Neal Maupay - The French striker cost Â£20m to sign from Brentford after he impressed in the Championship. Scored a reasonable number of goals for Brighton with 27 in 109 games over three seasons but did suffer long goal droughts and wasn't afraid to stir up controversy. Joined Everton for Â£15m in 2022. HIT (to a certain extent) Aaron Mooy - The Australian was signed for Â£5m having been on loan from Huddersfield. Stayed briefly then went off to Shanghai SIPG in China. MISS Tariq Lamptey - Signed as a 19-year-old from Chelsea for Â£5m and was really impressive from the outset surging down Brighton's right flank before a hamstring injury in December 2020 stalled his progress. Injury struggles would sadly become a theme for the Ghana international but he's still been a good signing. HIT  2020-21 SEASON Adam Lallana - Cost Brighton nothing when signed from Liverpool and his experience has proved very handy in midfielder across 79 games for them. Now 35, Lallana continues to play regularly for De Zerbi's side. HIT Jan Paul van Hecke - Arriving during the Covid pandemic from NAC Breda in his native Netherlands, Van Hecke was loaned out twice before making his Brighton breakthrough. Has been a regular starter at centre-back this season having extended his contract last summer. HIT Reda Khadra - Youngster brought in from Borussia Dortmund's second team, Khadra played just once for Brighton, was loaned out three times, and now plays for Reims in France. MISS Joel Veltman - The Netherlands international was a bargain signing from Ajax who has earned admiration for his levels of consistency over 128 matches for Brighton at right-back and centre-back. Was voted player of the season by Albion supporters in 2021-22 and also signed a new contract last summer. HIT  Andi Zeqiri - The Switzerland international forward made only a handful of appearances for the Seagulls after arriving from Lausanne for Â£3.5m. Spent much of his time at the club out on loan and joined Genk last September. MISS Michal Karbownik - Polish full-back who only made two appearances before going out on five different loan spells and is now in Germany with Hertha Berlin. MISS Jakub Moder - This Pole enjoyed much better fortunes, at least initially. Moder played regularly during the 2021-22 season before suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury which kept him sidelined for all of last season. The 24-year-old is finally back in action and hoping to get his career on track. JURY'S OUT Danny Welbeck - The erstwhile England international came in from Watford on a free in October 2020. Initially on a one-year deal, Welbeck is still with the club having scored 22 goals and set up a further 13 in 109 appearances. Scoring in a 3-1 away win at old club Man United back in September was another sweet moment. HIT  Evan Ferguson - Another brilliant success for Brighton's scouting team, albeit closer to home. Ferguson was playing first-team football for Bohemians in Ireland when he was only 14 and his progress since has been impressive. Last season saw a breakthrough with 10 goals in 25 games and United are among the clubs linked with him. HIT Moises Caicedo - A textbook example of how to unearth a gem of a footballer, polish them up a bit and sell them on for a mammoth profit. Caicedo cost Brighton just Â£4.5m to sign from Independiente del Valle in his native Ecuador in February 2021 and after basically one full season of Premier League football was sold to Chelsea for Â£115m. HIT   2021-22 SEASON Jeremy Sarmiento - Another Ecuador international, albeit born in Madrid, Sarmiento was signed into Brighton's academy from Benfica. Emerged into the first team under Graham Potter in the 2021-22 campaign and has spent this season on loan at first West Brom and currently Ipswich to gain experience. Has promise. JURY'S OUT Enock Mwepu - The Zambian midfielder, signed from Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg, struggled with injuries and illness but had started to make a positive impact at Brighton before the diagnosis of a rare hereditary heart condition forced him to retire from football in October 2022. Kaoru Mitoma - Another good example of the net being cast wide with Mitoma signed from Kawasaki Frontale in his native Japan. After a season on loan in Belgium with Union Saint-Gilloise, Mitoma did really well last season in English football with 10 goals. Has scored three times so far in the present campaign. HIT  Marc Cucurella - Another excellent bit of business. Cucurella joined from Getafe in Spain for about Â£15m in August 2021 and after just one very good season was off to Chelsea for Â£62m within 12 months. Really, how he performs at Stamford Bridge isn't Brighton's concern. HIT Abdallah Sima - Forward signed from Slavia Prague but has yet to feature for Brighton having been loaned to Stoke, Angers and Rangers. JURY'S OUT Kacper KozÅowski - Brighton fans haven't seen anything of the 20-year-old Polish midfielder yet as he's been out on loan to sister club Union SG in Belgium and two spells with Vitesse in the Netherlands. JURY'S OUT Deniz Undav - Eight goals in 30 outings for the forward last season after he scored at a prodigious rate for Union SG. Is currently enjoying a very productive loan spell with Stuttgart but it remains to be seen if Brighton have space for him permanently. JURY'S OUT  NEWCASTLE UNITED In February 2022, Ashworth took up the position of sporting director at Newcastle United. It was a statement of intent by Newcastle just months after their Saudi takeover and Ashworth certainly had a much larger budget to play with than at Brighton. 2022-23 SEASON Alexander Isak - Every football project needs a statement signing and the Â£62m spent to bring Swedish forward Isak from Real Sociedad was certainly that. Isak has largely lived up to the price tag, scoring 24 times in 52 appearances so far. Eddie Howe also compared one of his assists to something Thierry Henry might produce. Should be plenty more to come for the outlay. HIT Matt Targett - The left-back cost Â£15m when signed from Aston Villa but unfortunately his time with Newcastle so far has been disrupted by injuries, not least the hamstring problem that has him currently sidelined. Has plenty to prove still. JURY'S OUT   Nick Pope - A Â£10m arrival from Burnley, the England International proved great value for money as Newcastle's No 1 last season, keeping an impressive 18 clean sheets in total. Had eight more under his belt before his dislocated his shoulder against Man United back in December. HIT Sven Botman - The defender came in from Lille for Â£35m and was a mainstay in a great season for Newcastle in which they qualified for the Champions League and reached the Carabao Cup final. Like so many of his team-mates, this season has been interrupted by injury and Newcastle don't look quite as secure at the back. Botman has still proved a good signing though. HIT Loris Karius - The German's one and only Newcastle appearance after signing from Liverpool in September 2022 remains the Carabao Cup final. He was drafted in because Pope was suspended and second-choice Martin Dubravka cup-tied. In fairness, Karius made a number of good saves at Wembley in a losing cause but regular football looks unlikely. MISS Anthony Gordon - The young winger didn't come cheaply from Everton - his fee could be Â£45m eventually - but he's certainly proved his class. Gordon, 22, has eight goals and seven assists in 50 games so far, the majority this season after he settled into the challenge. There should be loads more to come too. HIT Harrison Ashby - Clearly intended as one for the future when signed from West Ham for Â£3m. Currently out on loan at Swansea in the Championship. JURY'S OUT   2023-24 SEASON Sandro Tonali - It's a case of delayed gratification for Toon fans when it comes to Tonali, who won't play again until next season as he serves out his 10-month betting ban. Questions about whether Newcastle carried out enough due diligence aside, Tonali did show plenty of promise in the 12 appearances he made before the bombshell news. Should be very good indeed. JURY'S OUT Harvey Barnes - Again, a chunky transfer fee of Â£38m but reasonable enough given he was one of Leicester's star performers and they'd just gone down. Scored one goal and set up another on Newcastle debut against Aston Villa but a foot injury has since slowed his progress. Has the feeling of another astute Ashworth signing though. JURY'S OUT Tino Livramento - At an initial Â£32m and with a potential Â£8m in add-ons, 21-year-old Livramento is a punt on the future and a signal of a willingness to invest in English talent. Has given Newcastle many reasons to be optimistic so far. HIT","Tino Livramento - At an initial Â£32m and with a potential Â£8m in add-ons, 21-year-old Livramento is a punt on the future and a signal of a willingness to invest in English talent.

However, they could have been, having seemingly been handed a big let-off inside the opening few minutes.  Leipzig thought they had the lead inside 120 seconds after Benjamin Sesko headed in from a mishit shot from Xavier Schlager. However, it was ruled out, seemingly for offside, although replays showed that Sesko himself was being played on by Rodrygo, who was late in coming out from the corner. VAR checked the decision, and sided with the on-field decision, which bewildered many spectators on social media. However, it can be noted that Andriy Lunin is possibly impeded by a Leipzig that is offside when Schlagerâs shot comes in, so that may be the reason why Real Madrid have not fallen behind.","VAR checked the decision, and sided with the on-field decision, which bewildered many spectators on social media.

Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25 per cent stake in the club was approved by the FA earlier in the week as the British billionaire prepares to sanction more board-level changes at Old Trafford. United are currently looking around other English clubs and elsewhere across Europe for top talents to help their sporting restructure and Wilcox is aware of their interest, as reported by The Athletic. Club executives in Manchester hold the 53-year-old in high regard, but are yet to approach Southampton over a deal to secure his exit. The 13-time Premier League champions are moving quick to put together a sporting board capable of returning the club to their former glories during Sir Alex Ferguson's reign.

Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth is expected to fulfil the same role at Old Trafford once the two Premier League clubs have come to an agreement.   Manchester City executive Omar Berrada has also been confirmed as United's new CEO and is expected to get started in the position in the summer. Wilcox would report into both Ashworth and Berrada if he was to swap the south coast for the north west and join the ranks at United.

Franck Kessie and Sebastien Haller scored the crucial goals for Emerse Fae's men after William Troost-Ekong had given Jose Peseiro's Super Eagles the lead and capped the hosts' comeback for the most unexpected of triumphs. Former manager Jean-Louis Gasset was dismissed midway through the tournament, which paved the way for Fae to come in as caretaker boss and lead his country past defending champions Senegal on penalties, Mali in extra time and DR Congo in the knockout phase route to the final.  It completed a remarkable turnaround for the home nation having been on the verge of elimination in Group A after defeats to the Nigerians and Equatorial Guinea only to survive as one of the best third-placed sides and advance all the way from there. Nigeria emerged as the other finalists after seeing off Cameroon, Angola and eventual third-placed South Africa and they took the lead through a looping Troost-Ekong header after 38 minutes which held until just after the hour.  It was another header, this time for Ivory Coast, which leveled things up on 62 minutes when Simon Adingra notched the first of his two assists when teeing up Kessie's unmarked header to beat Stanley Nwabili. It was Adingra who also set up the winner nine minutes from time as he whipped the ball in for Haller to flick home and complete a remarkable personal story after the Borussia Dortmund man's battle with testicular cancer. Nigeria were unable to find a response despite significant time added on at the end and Ivory Coast confirmed their third title which moves them level with the Super Eagles and sparked jubilation at Stade Alassane Ouattara. Legendary former Ivory Coast international Didier Drogba was present in Abidjan and was seen joining in the celebrations as the hosts completed their miraculous recovery to triumph much to the delight of just over 60,000 spectators. The Ivorians last triumphed back in 2015 but this was the first time that a host national has won an AFCON title on home soil since record seven-time winners Egypt back in 2006 when the Elephants were runners-up. 0' The match is about to start!   7' Highlight from Nigeria vs Ivory Coast   20' Highlight from Nigeria vs Ivory Coast   33' Match Event for Nigeria vs Ivory Coast   38' GOAL!

After a flurry of reports that Mbappe had decided to play at Real Madrid next season, no agreement has been found.  Los Blancos have offered Mbappe far less money than they did previously, which was around â¬26m per year in salary and a â¬130m in a signing bonus. Paris Saint-Germain on the other hand have given Mbappe options over his renewal, offering him a choice of contract length, and a salary of â¬75m after tax, before taking into account any bonuses.+ Real Madrid President Florentino Perez has been handling negotiations personally, and was initially optimistic about a deal, communicating as much to Carlo Ancelotti. His argument to convince Mbappe has been that he will take the next step in terms of reputation, marketing and on the pitch. Yet PSG are still maintaining hope, and Mbappeâs entourage â read here his agent and mother Fayza Lamari â have doubts about the offer from Spain being the best there is. The Athletic say that is a big part of the reason the deal had not been done, although Los Blancos expect a response soon. They have made their terms clear. It may well be that Lamari is simply trying to secure more money for her client and son, and even though the decision has been made, is still trying to squeeze a better deal from Real Madrid. They will not be able to come close to PSGâs offer, but the longer the deal goes on, the more anxiety it will create in the talks.","It may well be that Lamari is simply trying to secure more money for her client and son, and even though the decision has been made, is still trying to squeeze a better deal from Real Madrid.

599,Petr Cech reveals his favourite Chelsea managers & most important player,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Petr-Cech-reveals-his-favourite-Chelsea-managers--most-important-player/3301141,13 Feb,"Chelsea legend Petr Cech has revealed who he thinks the Blues' most important players were during his time at the club.  Cech was at Chelsea between 2004 and 2015 and enjoyed much success, playing alongside numerous star names. During his time at Chelsea, Cech made 494 appearances and won an array of trophies including the Champions League, four league titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and the Europa League. The former goalkeeper says English stars Frank Lampard and John Terry were of much importance to Chelsea. Speaking to Sky Sports, when asked who Chelsea's most important player was in their successful era, Cech said: 'That's hard, that's very hard. If you take English club, it would be either Frank or JT.' Cech was then pressed on who his favourite manager was at Chelsea, to which he replied Jose Mourinho. Mourinho had two spells as Chelsea manager and won the league three times. Cech added that Carlo Ancelotti was his second favourite Chelsea boss. Ancelotti was in charge of Chelsea between between 2009 and 2011, winning the Premier League in his first season in charge. Subsequently, Cech was asked who he thinks the best goalkeeper in world football is at present. The 41-year-old went for Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson ahead of Ederson and Thibaut Courtois. Cech said: 'There is a competition between Alisson, Ederson and Courtois. This season Courtois was injured, I'd go with Alisson.' Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher asked Cech if Luis Garcia's infamous 'ghost goal' in the 2005 Champions League semi-final actually went in. Cech replied: 'I don't think it was in. Somebody put the 3D picture. If it was not in it should have been a penalty because I collided with Milan Baros.'     Cech was asked whether Chelsea or Arsenal will win the title next. Cech claimed that Arsenal are more likely to do so and added that they could be champions this season. He said: At this moment I think Arsenal. This season it will be very close. I actually think Arsenal might do it.' Cech also stated his best night as a Chelsea goalkeeper was the Champions League final triumph against Bayern Munich in 2012, which included him saving a penalty from Arjen Robben in extra-time.","Cech also stated his best night as a Chelsea goalkeeper was the Champions League final triumph against Bayern Munich in 2012, which included him saving a penalty from Arjen Robben in extra-time."

David Moyes' side headed into the break at the London Stadium trailing 4-0, with thousands of fans seen leaving in their numbers early. Keane said: 'West Ham, shocking.

'I can't believe what I'm watching. The way they get beaten physically, set pieces... West Ham the last 10 or 15 minutes have been an absolute disgrace.' ",
601,Atletico Madrid struck by unusual issue as decisive stretch looms,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Atletico-Madrid-struck-by-unusual-issue-as-decisive-stretch-looms/3301712,2 days ago,"Atletico Madrid are hitting the crunch phase of their season, and will be hoping for progress in both of their remaining cup competitions, but have had the breaks put on them in their last two matches. The next month, before the March international break, Atletico will likely have a much better understanding of whether their season will be successful or not.  They cannot afford to take their eye off the ball too much in La Liga over the coming month, with Athletic Club just two points behind them in fifth place. Ahead lie Las Palmas (H), Almeria (A), Real Betis (H), Cadiz (A) and Barcelona (H) before the international break. Mixed in are the crucial Champions League legs against Inter away (20/2), at home (13/3) and the return leg against Athletic Club in the Copa del Rey semi-finals (29/2), when they must overturn a 1-0 deficit to make it through to the final. The issue is that Los Rojiblancos have been relying on their explosive offence all season to cover up their defensive deficencies and before the past week were averaging 2.32 goals per game, totalling 71 for the season already. However two 1-0 defeats to Athletic and Sevilla saw them take 36 shots over the course of 180 minutes, but failed to put the ball away, as reported by Marca. If they cannot do so in the coming weeks, it could be real struggle for Diego Simeoneâs side. Memphis Depay has returned to the side in good form in 2024, but an injury to Alvaro Morata, which will keep him out for a few weeks will exacerbate the problem. In addition, Antoine Griezmann has looked tired and less effective in recent weeks. The onus will be on Angel Correa and Memphis to step up in the coming weeks, while Samuel Lino and Rodrigo Riquelme will also be asked to provide goals. None of their central midfielders are known for providing goals, and as such, it will be the forwards and wide players that are required to ease the load on Griezmann.","The onus will be on Angel Correa and Memphis to step up in the coming weeks, while Samuel Lino and Rodrigo Riquelme will also be asked to provide goals.

Barcelona are very reluctant to sell Araujo this summer despite their well documented financial problems, as they see him as a key player for both now and the future. Within the Catalan club, he is strongly considered as their best defender, and they would much rather sell others â such as Jules Kounde â over Araujo. The meeting heralded good news for Barcelona, as Jijantes FC have reported that Araujoâs agent told Deco that the player intends to see out the remainder of his contract at the very least, meaning that no sale will be considered this summer. Furthermore, discussions were held over a possible new contract for Araujo, something that Barcelona intend to present to the 24-year-old. However, at this stage, thereâs no indications as to whether this is something that will be possible.","Furthermore, discussions were held over a possible new contract for Araujo, something that Barcelona intend to present to the 24-year-old.

603,Van Dijk sends message to Man City after Liverpool stay top of EPL table,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Van-Dijk-sends-message-to-Man-City-after-Liverpool-stay-top-of-EPL-table/3300870,12 Feb,"Virgil van Dijk says Liverpool are enjoying their title challenge rather than feeling the pressure of being the hunted.  Despite reigning champions Manchester City winning 10 games in a row in all competitions with a game extra to play, the Reds remain two points clear at the top of the table thanks to Saturdayâs win against Burnley. And motivated by the desire to give departing manager Jurgen Klopp the most memorable of send offs in May, Van Dijk believes the mood in the Anfield dressing room is one of excitement more than fear. âI think everyone would love to be in this situation that you are on the top and fighting for the pinnacle, which is winning the Premier League in this case,â he said. âWe are in a situation that I think last year around this time, you would never, well maybe not never as you never know, but you wouldnât have believed where we are today. Letâs just enjoy the moment and we have to perform as players, but together everyone has to play their part.â On Saturday Liverpool overcame their defeat away to fellow challengers Arsenal by putting relegation candidates Burnley to the sword. With several key players missing, and the flu making its way through the dressing room, the Redsâ professional response to the loss in north London was impressive. Van Dijk added: âWe obviously came on the back of a very disappointing day in London. We wanted to show a reaction for ourselves. The start [against Burnley] wasnât great, we canât deny that, but I think how we turned the second half around and stayed calm was good. âWe can only influence what we are doing. Thatâs the only thing. We wanted to win, no matter what, find a way to win, we did that and now we have a couple of days off, hopefully everyone can get fresh again and no flu and injuries and everything like that.â And after Trent Alexander-Arnold was substituted at the break with a knee injury, Van Dijk says the squadâs next-man-up mentality is standing them in good stead. âIt is not ideal but we have to adapt and thatâs football,â he said. âWhoever is going to be on that pitch has to perform, that is what we all expect as well. âWe are in the middle of a very intense period with games on the very highest level and pressure. Everyone has to be ready to perform. âEven if you start on the bench, you have to be ready to make an impact. This was a great example of that again. This season there has been a lot of players who have come from the bench and made a difference. Thatâs what we need.â","âEven if you start on the bench, you have to be ready to make an impact.

A bumpy, injury-hit start to the season saw pressure mount on manager Erik ten Hag as his side were eliminated from Europe and stumbled on the domestic front. But there have been signs of improvement since the turn of the year, with Unitedâs unbeaten start to 2024 continuing with a late, hard-fought Premier League win at Villa.

The bullet header allowed sixth-placed United to reduce the gap to Villa in fifth to five points, with Tottenham a point better off in fourth. Scott McTominay (right) celebrates with Manchester United team-mate Rasmus Hojlund  âI think it is a really important win,â Dalot said of the push for Champions League qualification. âWe knew that today was like a final for us; pretty much every game will be for us now if we want to get top four. âWe prepared well and I am very happy with the way we performed and how we fought until the end to get the win. âIt was registered (how important the Villa match was) at the start of the week when we started preparing for the game.

Dalot praised goalkeeper Andre Onana for his performance â âheâs been fighting for itâ, he said â and went onto highlight the impact of Unitedâs forwards. âWhen we start scoring goals, you can see how fresh they are and how motivated they are and we are very happy that they are scoring goals,â the Portugal international said. â(Hojlund) brings calm and thatâs what wins games and gives you more confidence. âHe has adapted to the team really well and we have adapted to him really well. Hopefully, he can score a lot more goals.â Hojlundâs fifth goal in five Premier League appearances continued a run that started with his winner in 3-2 Boxing Day turnaround against Villa. Aston Villaâs Jacob Ramsey reacts as his shot goes wide  Unai Emeryâs side came away with nothing from those matches and midfielder Jacob Ramsey bemoaned a lack of killer instinct on Sunday. âWe want to win games and weâve not been great at home recently but we can take positives from the performance,â he said. âManchester United are a big team and we were dominant today.

Thibaut Courtois tore his ACL in training just days before the start of the campaign, and on MD1, Eder Militao did the same after an innocuous slip against Athletic Club.  Both players have been unavailable since then, although they are in (or at least nearing) the final stages of their respective recoveries. Militao is expected to return first, despite having suffered his injury more recently, and this was confirmed by Toni Kroos, who provided an update on both players, as per Fabrizio Romano. âFrom what Iâve seen, Eder Militao is on a really good path. I think weâll see him this season, heâs working with the ball already. âCourtois? I donât know, Iâm not able to predict return schedule for a goalkeeper as itâs different.â Having both players back before the end of the season would be a major boost for Real Madrid, but especially in the case of Militao, given the injury struggles that have occurred in the centre-back department in recent weeks/months.","Having both players back before the end of the season would be a major boost for Real Madrid, but especially in the case of Militao, given the injury struggles that have occurred in the centre-back department in recent weeks/months."

608,Do the Premier League want to relegate Everton? Phil Jagielka poses question,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Do-the-Premier-League-want-to-relegate-Everton-Phil-Jagielka-poses-question/3301716,2 days ago,"Former Everton star Phil Jagielka has questioned whether the Premier League are trying to relegate his former club.  The Toffees, who have spent more seasons in the top flight than any other team, are currently in the relegation zone due to their 10-point deduction. Sean Dyche's side would be sitting comfortably in 12th place if those points hadn't been deducted. As Everton await the outcome of their appeal against the decision - which it's understood was concluded on February 2 - Jagielka has voiced concerns about potential bias against the club. Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Blues skipper said: ""I can see why they (the fans) think that way. I can't believe that there's only one club that's ever made bad decisions financially since the Premier League started. âThereâs only one team thatâs been deducted points. I donât know the ins and outs and whether the rules have changed blah, blah, blah, but if other clubs have got away with it, you canât say itâs still pending, these investigations are pending for 25 years, who is going to care whatâs gone on? âItâs got to be done within a timeframe and it seems that for whatever reason someone has decided that this was going to happen very sharpish.â Manchester City are facing 115 alleged breaches of financial regulations, but there is no end in sight when it comes to them being actually sanctioned by Premier League bosses. Jagielka, when asked if he thinks Everton are being treated unfairly compared to others, said: ""It seems like they are but we don't know enough information where maybe 95 of Man City's counts were done before they changed the rules because they don't give us enough information, they don't really let us know. All we're left to do is speculate. ""Evertonians are going to feel victimised as will Forest fans if Forest get points deducted and they end up going down or someone else does. I was at Derby and stuff was done wrong and it was points after points after points. ""In the end, the Football League made sure Derby got relegated. And whether they meant to or didn't mean to, you can't deduct 20 odd points and expect a team to survive and say you can't pay your players more than x amount and that x amount probably isn't enough to field a League Two or even a top Conference team. ""You're basically saying in a roundabout way that you've done wrong, now you're going to pay the price which is automatically going to be relegation. It seems like something quite similar when you look what's going on at Everton."" Jagielka also questioned why Everton have been punished so harshly with a points deduction for a single breach greater than the nine that Portsmouth had taken off them for going into administration in 2009-10. He said: ""I knew it wasn't a great situation before the points (deduction). Obviously there's been a financial strain on the club for a little while now, selling their best players, selling their young lads to try and make the FFP (Financial Fair Play). ""When I heard there was going to be 10 points, which is a significant amount of points when you're talking about the Premier League, it's not a 46-game season, 10 points is a lot, especially considering that Everton have only survived literally the last game of the season and then two games from the end the year before that. ""They got galvanised, the team did well and got themselves out of it but then you open the newspaper or listen to the radio and you realise that there is potentially more points on the horizon. I don't know what's going on, I don't know how and who comes up with the ideas of how many points and how quickly this has been done. ""There have been plenty of other teams who have supposedly bent the rules slightly or more than slightly shall we say over the course of the years but that's never been sorted or figured out. All of a sudden, Everton have been given 10 points and Forest, who have been in the Premier League no time at all, and all of a sudden they're on the radar as well. ""Something's not right. I presume some rules must have been broken for Everton to accept it but it's tough times."" Jagielka admitted that Everton's financial problems are down to the squandering of huge amounts of money during Farhad Moshiri's ownership of the club. The Blues' now wantaway majority shareholder has churned his way through eight managers in as many years and spent big on a number of flops during his time on Merseyside. Jagielka added: ""Part of it was happening towards my last year or two. You've got to understand what your club is and what your club gives to the league and where you should be. ""The owners came in at Chelsea and similar at Manchester City again, and they were able to flex their muscles and literally go and buy a team that was going to challenge for the top of the division. When Everton's money came around, there were already five or six teams who were plenty good enough to win the Premier League, when Chelsea and Manchester City did it there was probably one or two and Liverpool weren't the Liverpool that we're looking at now, it was Man United, Arsenal or whatever. ""They just spent the money in the wrong places. They tried to buy people without probably doing their homework."" ""When I was at Everton, I think they called David Moyes 'Dithering Dave' but I think the reason he was so dithering was because he cared so much about the squad and we didn't have much money. It was all about making sure we not only got a player who was going to perform on the pitch but the right characters in the dressing room as well."" ""That made your team. You had individuals that would win you games but the core squad and the core team would make your season was a successful one."" ""It just drifted, drifted, drifted and before you know it they're sacking managers left, right and centre, releasing players, we're selling people you don't want to sell and that's purely down to mismanagement of the money.""","""It just drifted, drifted, drifted and before you know it they're sacking managers left, right and centre, releasing players, we're selling people you don't want to sell and that's purely down to mismanagement of the money."""

As names continue to fly around, some of Barcelonaâs board are reportedly dreaming of the forbidden fruit.  Catalan daily Sport claim that a section of the hierarchy at Barcelona would like to get ahead of the pack and move for Bayer Leverkusenâs Xabi Alonso. The former Real Madrid midfielder is flavour of the month due to his sterling work with Leverkusen, who are unbeaten in the Bundesliga and five points clear of Bayern Munich. His credentials were confirmed by their 3-0 victory over Bayern on Saturday night, as they dominated the Bavarians. Itâs noted that Alonso spent part of his childhood in Barcelona, and then later in satellite town Sabadell. Some of the board want to get ahead of their competitors, and try to convince him. Real Madrid are not in need of a manager currently, but Bayern Munich have been linked with a move for him, and another former club in Liverpool will no doubt be hoping he replaces Jurgen Klopp at Anfield. Barcelona will have their work cut out. Beyond loyalty to his former clubs, Alonsoâs managerial career so far has been characterised by his patience to wait for the right opportunities, starting at Real Madridâs under-19s, before moving to Real Sociedad B, and then Leverkusen. Alonso will have his pick of jobs this summer if he wants to leave, and Barcelona are not exactly an easy landing spot currently.","Barcelona will have their work cut out.

613,Villa fans fume as replays show Casemiro was offside in build-up to Man Utd goal,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Villa-fans-fume-as-replays-show-Casemiro-was-offside-in-build-up-to-Man-Utd-goal/3300764,12 Feb,"Aston Villa fans have expressed frustration over Casemiro allegedly being offside in the build-up to Manchester United's first goal in their crucial 2-1 win in the Premier League on Sunday.  The Red Devils took the lead at Villa Park in the 17th minute, with Rasmus Hojlund turning in Harry Maguire's header from a corner. Man United's corner had followed a free kick from Luke Shaw, which was turned behind by an Aston Villa defender under pressure from Casemiro. Replays have shown that the Brazilian midfielder had been in an offside position when the free kick was taken and had competed for the ball. By competing for the ball Casemiro should have been adjudged to have been offside.   The corner leading to Man United's opener was given instead, with VAR unable to intervene due to the set piece marking a new phase of play. Aston Villa supporters reacted with frustration to the Casemiro not being flagged offside from the free kick, with Man United taking the lead in a key match in the race for Champions League football. 'To really put the icing on the cake, Casemiro was offside from the free-kick which led to the corner,' one Villa fan said. 'I hate football on days like today. Really didn't do a fat lot wrong and end up on the defeated side. And it's always against them too. Irritating. Another Villa fan said 'Poor set-piece defending from us, but it wasn't a foul on Rashford leading up to the corner. 'Casemiro was offside and went for the ball despite not touching it; could be argued as taking part in that phase of play.' 'That Man U goal was crazy. Softest free kick of the season which then led to Casemiro being offside when they forced a corner in which they scored,' claimed a third. 'Referees so scared to make the right decisions, getting too complacent with VAR.'     Aston Villa responded impressively to falling behind with Douglas Luiz drawing the hosts level in the second half. Villa were undone in the closing minutes as substitute Scott McTominay headed Man United back in front in the 87th minute to secure a dramatic 2-1 victory. The result could prove crucial in the race for Champions League football, with Man United closing the gap to fifth place Aston Villa to five points. Defeat also saw Unai Emery's side slip outside of the top four over the weekend, with Tottenham now a point ahead after their last 2-1 home against Brighton.","Defeat also saw Unai Emery's side slip outside of the top four over the weekend, with Tottenham now a point ahead after their last 2-1 home against Brighton."
614,Hojlund has made his feelings clear on leaving Man Utd amid Real Madrid interest,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hojlund-has-made-his-feelings-clear-on-leaving-Man-Utd-amid-Real-Madrid-interest/3302087,1 day ago,"Real Madrid are reportedly monitoring Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker has already declared that he and Manchester United are ""the perfect match"".  The Denmark international, 21, joined the Red Devils from Atalanta in a Â£72million deal back in the summer transfer window and is finally starting to find his feet after a challenging start to life in the Premier League. After going months without a league goal, Hojlund has now plundered in five consecutive matches during United's recent resurgence, taking his total tally for the season to 11 goals in all competitions - and his upturn in form has not gone unnoticed across Europe. According to reports in Spain, Real Madrid are monitoring Hojlund with the club's chief scout, Juni Calafat, tasked with keeping tabs on United's No.11. However, it remains to be seen if the prospect of such a move would appeal to Hojlund, who has openly admitted in the past that he was a huge Manchester United fan growing up. He's only affirmed those feelings since joining the club, telling Danish television back in August: âIt's about dreaming big and daring to dream big. Otherwise, you will not reach your goals. It's rare you get everything in one package, but I'd say everything has just come together with me and Manchester United. It's a perfect match.â He added: âRight now the club is going through a process, and I would very much like to be a part of it. This is also why I have chosen to come here now, because I feel I can grow with the club, and hopefully we can win a lot of trophies together.â Erik ten Hag lavished praise on the striker earlier this month for his perseverance following his challenging start to life at Old Trafford. He said: âHe is a great character, always keeps going. He always wants to improve. And you see now the team is better and the team is more stable, now we serve the front line better and that he starts scoring. âYou see there's something growing with Rashy [Marcus Rashford], with [Alejandro] Garnacho, with Bruno [Fernandes] in the back, also other players from the second and the third line. So he's coming more in the position to score. âBut I can tell you, it's not easy for a striker when you have high expectations from yourself. Also, I think the outside world has high expectations to fulfil that, and when it's not working, of course, that is the character every striker needs. He gets angry, he gets mad when he's not scoring but also that's why we selected him.â","âBut I can tell you, it's not easy for a striker when you have high expectations from yourself.

615,"Rio Ferdinand warns Ivan Toney he ""won't last long"" at Arsenal after transfer comments",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Rio-Ferdinand-warns-Ivan-Toney-he-wont-last-long-at-Arsenal-after-transfer-comments/3301331,13 Feb,"Rio Ferdinand has told Ivan Toney that he will cause himself problems if he lets his ego get the better of him should he join Arsenal in the summer.  The Brentford striker, 27, was heavily linked with a move to the Gunners ahead of the January transfer window and is likely to attract further interest in the summer given he will have just one year remaining on his current contract. Toney had a tongue-in-cheek response to comments from Thomas Frank earlier this week after the Bees boss admitted it was likely Brentford would sell their star man in the summer. Toney quipped: ""I see that [Frank's comments] as he doesn't want me! ""The manager has said what he's said but I can't make clubs come and get me. I've just got to keep doing what I do and that's score goals. What will be will be."" And while Ferdinand feels people have taken Toney's comments the wrong way, he's warned the former Newcastle man that big egos won't be tolerated by the Premier League's elite - both on and off the field. Speaking on his Five podcast, Ferdinand said of Toney's comments: ""He said it in jest! I donât think he would move like that [with a big ego]. I would be surprised. Remember, he has never played for a big club. Heâs going to go there and he will have to be respectful and know where he is in the pecking order. ""There are some big players in there. Do you think he is going to come with that chat about Mikel Arteta when you have Declan Rice, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Jesus?"" When it was then put to Ferdinand that Toney's confidence could, in fact, lead him to act in the same manner at one of the Premier League's top clubs, the former Manchester United man sent the sought after striker an ominous warning. After being told ""he thinks no one can chat to him"", Ferdinand continued: ""Then he wonât last long then. I donât think that is him, but if he goes into the dressing room, a strong dressing room like Arsenal, and thinks, âNo one can chat to meâ â thatâs where the dressing room will be tested. The manager wouldnât have to say anything. He would be opened up."" After returning from an eight-month ban for breaching betting regulations, Toney has plundered three goals in four Premier League games for Brentford, who will be expecting to receive significant compensation for their talisman in the summer.","After returning from an eight-month ban for breaching betting regulations, Toney has plundered three goals in four Premier League games for Brentford, who will be expecting to receive significant compensation for their talisman in the summer."
616,Manchester City Women goalkeeper Khiara Keating produces superb performance,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Manchester-City-Women-goalkeeper-Khiara-Keating-produces-superb-performance/3300707,12 Feb,"One set-piece, two controversial refereeing decisions and a superb performance by goalkeeper Khiara Keating ensured Manchester Cityâs progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals.  Both teams were chasing their first piece of silverware in some time, with Arsenal having won just one trophy in the last five years. The first half was cagey as the sides kept possession rather than taking a more risky approach that would leave them vulnerable to a counter-attack. City, despite the dynamism of Khadija Shaw, Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp, did not register a shot on target. England manager Sarina Wiegman, who was watching in the stands, will have been pleased to see her captain Leah Williamson put in a strong performance in just her second start since returning from an ACL injury. She was Arsenalâs best player for large spells, switching play with pinpoint diagonal passes and clearing a Shaw header off the line. But it was City who finally broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute through a Kelly set-piece. The England international sent her free-kick into the box and the ball fell for Laia Aleixandri, who gratefully poked home. The goal breathed life into the game and Arsenal responded through Beth Mead moments later, who delivered a superb cross to Victoria Pelova. The 24-year-old was unlucky not to find the net, Keating making an excellent save. Keating was called into action again moments later, saving a shot from Kim Little which looked to have crossed the line. But without goal-line technology, City maintained their lead. Another penalty shout from Stina Blackstenius was also waved away. Gunners manager Jonas Eidevall expressed his frustration at the refereeing. He said: âWeâre on the wrong side of the margins. If that ball is over the line or not, if thatâs a penalty or not, those are difficult decisions to deal with right now.â   Arsenal have now suffered back-to-back defeats, having surprisingly lost 1-0 to West Ham last weekend. Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Nottingham Forest were on the end of a 7-1 thumping at home to Everton, who had seven different goalscorers, including an own-goal. Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1. Ella Toone scored an early goal before Lexi Lloyd-Smith levelled, but a late brace from Rachel Williams won it. Brighton beat Wolves 4-1, Emma Kullbergâs first goal of her hat-trick coming in the 88th minute. A goal for Mayra Ramirez eased Chelsea past Crystal Palace and Liverpool beat London City Lionesses 2-0.","Brighton beat Wolves 4-1, Emma Kullbergâs first goal of her hat-trick coming in the 88th minute.

Los Blancos come into the game in excellent form, having thumped Girona 4-0 on Saturday night. They face an RB Leipzig that have been in mixed form, and will be heavy favourites to head through.  Leipzig have just one clean sheet in their last 16 matches, and are facing Vinicius Junior after what some are calling the best performance of his career. Los Blancos will be without Jude Bellingham though, who has been ruled out for multiple weeks with an ankle issue. Ahead of the game in Leipzig, during their Tuesday training session, Ancelotti told his side that they needed a big performance. âWe are going to winâ¦ We have to play a huge game,â Ancelotti told his charges, as Movistar+ captured. âWe are doing well because I think we are on a good streak, we are in a good moment. The team is motivated and excited, they are returning to the Champions League, the competition that we like a lot and we are playing against a powerful rival. Leipzig plays with intensity and quality in attack. We have to plan a complete game in the defensive and offensive aspects,â Ancelotti explained in his press conferene, as covered by MD. Real Madrid will have a makeshift defence in action again, with Nacho Fernandez being partnered by Aurelien Tchouameni, although if the Frenchman defends like he did against Girona, then they will have few issues.","Real Madrid will have a makeshift defence in action again, with Nacho Fernandez being partnered by Aurelien Tchouameni, although if the Frenchman defends like he did against Girona, then they will have few issues."

The two Clasico clubs are keen for the Super League to take place, although there has been strong opposition for it across Europe, not least from within Spain. Atletico Madrid rejected the competition when its new format was released, and CEO Miguel Angel Gil Marin again hit out at it on Wednesday, as per Estadio Deportivo. âMaking closed leagues, or guaranteeing the presence in the top competitions only to a few,Â would destroy the pyramid in which the dream of thousands of boys and girls is based. Only those boys who were linked to the privileged clubs would have access to the elite, the tradition of rewarding sporting merit would be broken. âIt is necessary to protect the balance and evolution in the pyramid of amateur and professional football, it is part of our culture and tradition. Contrary to what the Super League advocates, UEFA seeks a balance between large, small and medium-sized countries; between clubs, large, small and medium-sized. âToday we are 55 countries, and of those, more than 35 compete in European competitions every year. UEFA created the three current competitions, Champions League, Europa League and Conference League, to accommodate more clubs and protect sporting merit. The champions of each competition are promoted to the top in each season, and access to each European competition is achieved through qualification in the domestic leagues, thereby protecting them.â At this stage, the Super League doesnât look like it will be moving forward any time soon due to a distinct lack of support.

But the Portuguese coach, 61, insists he doesn't have unfinished business at Manchester United, saying the rumours were 'not from me'. Mourinho was fired by Roma on January 16 despite leading the Italian club to back-to-back European finals. They sat ninth in Serie A at the time and Mourinho's touchline antics had started to cause problems. Speaking to Rio Ferdinand's FIVE podcast, the former United, Chelsea and Real Madrid boss said he intended to throw himself into a new challenge as quickly as possible, with some offers already turned down.   'I was having lunch with my friends and people that works with me and we were in the lift. I was telling the guys if I can work tomorrow, I work tomorrow,' Football.com global ambassador Mourinho said. 'I don't enjoy any day without work. I don't understand, I'm sorry guys. But I don't understand people that speak about sabbatical time. 'Sabbatical time gives me only one thing - depression. So I want a different job. I just want to work but I need to be patient.' Mourinho added he has received job offers since leaving Roma but 'it was not something I was interested in.' He coached United between 2016 and 2018, winning the EFL Cup and the Europa League during his first season, but insisted suggestions he wants to return are wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola took a sabbatical between the Barcelona and Bayern Munich jobs in 2012-13 and lived in New York. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp also hinted he may take some time out from the game when he leaves Anfield this summer after admitting the job had made him 'exhausted'.  ",

In a new documentary about Defoe, which is released at the end of the month, the former England striker is asked how his 2008 move from Tottenham came about and says: âIt was Harry Redknapp. I remember getting a phone call.â Redknapp then accepts that Defoeâs recollections are âprobablyâ correct and that he was âbreaking all the rulesâ. The ex-Portsmouth boss adds: âIf he was under contract at Tottenham, he canât be talking to me. I could be called up before the FA over this.â Although Redknapp retired from management in 2017, the FA would still have the power to sanction the 76-year-old. However, the governing body have indicated they are prepared to turn a blind eye to Redknappâs apparent admission of tapping up, with sources telling Mail Sport they have no plans to investigate the matter further having watched the footage.  It was unclear on Thursday night whether the Premier League could look into the matter themselves, but they suggested it would usually require a club to make an official complaint. Defoeâs switch to Fratton Park 16 years ago has already been under scrutiny after it emerged in November that an unlicensed agent was used during the negotiations. Following an investigation into the transfer by The Times, the FA initially said they were âlooking at the caseâ, before later closing it without any further action. Defoe joined Portsmouth from Tottenham for Â£7.5million on January deadline day in 2008 but a year later he re-signed for Spurs for Â£15m after Redknapp had moved there as manager. In his film, Defoe also appears to suggest Redknapp personally contacted him again about returning to White Hart Lane. He says: âI had a little smile to myself and thought, âOK, just wait for the phone to ringâ. I knew what was going to happen.â Later in the documentary, Defoe also admits to receiving a text message from then Sunderland manager Gus Poyet before joining the Black Cats from MLS side Toronto in January 2015. Defoe says: âThe text said, âHave we got a chance? Gusâ. So I said to Gus, âIf you speak to Toronto, Iâve got permission to talk. Iâd love to be back in the Premier Leagueâ.â Rule T.1.2. of the Premier League handbook states that a club can only approach a player âwith the prior written consent of the club to which he is contractedâ. Individuals can be punished by fines or bans, while clubs can be hit with transfer bans or even points deductions. Redknapp was previously accused of tapping up Blackburn defender Andy Todd in a BBC Panorama documentary in 2006, allegations he dismissed at the time as âfarcicalâ.   In 2009, the then Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie was quoted as saying: âThe reality is we all know all managers tap players up.â Redknapp told Mail Sport on Thursday night: âI donât think there is any transfer that has ever been done in the history of transfers where the manger or somebody at the football club hasnât spoken to the player or the agent before the dealâs done. Itâs just standard. Thatâs what happens. Anybody who thinks it doesnât is not in the real world. âThere is always someone speaking to the player or speaking to the agent before you ever meet officially. Of course it happens. It has happened for ever.â The FA and Premier League declined to comment.",The FA and Premier League declined to comment.

It comes after a somewhat underwhelming 12 months at the Premier League club for Fernandez, who joined in the aftermath of winning the World Cup with Argentina in December 2022.  However, he has moved quickly to quash this speculation. Speaking after scoring for Chelsea in their 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Monday evening. Fernandez confirmed that the Barcelona rumours are fake, and that he only wants to remain in west London, as per MD. âI donât want to leave Chelsea. Iâve been very happy here with my teammates and the coaching staff since the first day I arrived. The people at the club treat me very well, Iâm grateful for that. Iâll stay here until they want me to leave. I donât know where those rumours came from; they had appeared on social media. Iâm coming out to totally deny them.â The fact of the matter is that even if Fernandez wanted to join Barcelona, a deal would have been next to impossible anyway, due to Chelseaâs likely demands and the Catalan sideâs ongoing financial woes. Itâs safe to say that this matter can be put to bed.","The fact of the matter is that even if Fernandez wanted to join Barcelona, a deal would have been next to impossible anyway, due to Chelseaâs likely demands and the Catalan sideâs ongoing financial woes.

Arteta showed his admiration for Clarets manager Vincent Kompany, lauding his âspecial auraâ ahead of Saturdayâs clash. The Arsenal manager coached the former Manchester City captain when he was Pep Guardiolaâs assistant at the Etihad Stadium between 2016 and 2019. âWe know each other really well and I have huge respect for him, we had a really good relationship when we worked together,â Arteta added. âI have a huge admiration for him when he was a player and he has a special aura around him. He has great ideas and a vision of how to play the game. âWhat they did in the Championship last season (winning the league by 10 points) was phenomenal in a record season.

625,Arsenal and Chelsea given boost in Nico Williams pursuit as Athletic Club eye up replacement,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-and-Chelsea-given-boost-in-Nico-Williams-pursuit-as-Athletic-Club-eye-up-replacement/3301380,2 days ago,"Athletic Club are having a marvellous season. After 24 matchdays, they sit fifth in La Liga â and only two points off the top four. Furthermore, they are well placed to reach the Copa del Rey final, having defeated Atletico Madrid 1-0 in the first leg of their semi-final tie at the Civitas Metropolitano last week.  Given this, it looks highly likely that Los Leones will be playing some form of European football next season, whether that be in the Champions League, Europa League or the Conference League. If they are to do this, it would have a significant effect on their transfer business this summer. According to Diario AS, should Athletic secure European football for next season, they will make a move for Bragaâs Alvaro Djalo. The Portuguese forward has 13 goals across all competitions this season, and is regarded as one of the most promising attacking players in Portugal. A deal could be done for a fee in the region of â¬10m. A move for Djalo is likely to move forward if Nico Williams ends up leaving Athletic Club in the summer. Arsenal and Chelsea are both credited with an interest in the 21-year-old, who has a â¬50m release clause in the contract he signed two months ago. Djalo could well end up being his replacement.","A move for Djalo is likely to move forward if Nico Williams ends up leaving Athletic Club in the summer.

The 24-year-old is out of contract at Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season, meaning that he can now negotiate with other clubs. Real Madrid are firmly in the race, and there is growing confidence that an agreement will finally be sealed.  However, itâs not there yet. Marca have reported that Mbappe has yet to agree terms with Real Madrid, despite the fact that a decision on his future is expected imminently. Whatâs more is that Los Blancos are having problems during negotiations with Mbappeâs agent and mother, Fayza Lamari. Lamari is sticking to her guns during negotiations with Real Madrid in order to receive the best possible terms for her and her son, even though Mbappe is apparently willing to give in. The report states that the two parties are far apart on agreeing terms, which could be a significant problem. It remains to be seen how this one plays out. Real Madrid are very keen to finally get their hands on Mbappe, but they wonât be held to ranson, especially because of the situation from two years ago. For now, itâs hard to call which way things will fall.","It remains to be seen how this one plays out.

629,PLAYER RATINGS | PSG 2-0 Real Sociedad: MbappÃ© and Barcola seal first-leg win,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/PLAYER-RATINGS-%7C-PSG-2-0-Real-Sociedad-Mbapp%C3%A9-and-Barcola-seal-first-leg-win/3302030,1 day ago,"The tired axiom that Paris Saint-Germainâs season only ever really starts in February does, admittedly, have some truth to it. For all their domestic dominance (although the story this season has been more nuanced than their 11-point lead at the top suggests) overcoming the mental block of the Champions League knockout stages was always going to be Luis Enriqueâs first real test in charge.  For most of tonightâs last 16 first leg against Real Sociedad, it looked as though their continental stage fright would get the better of them again. The hosts were decidedly not up to the task in the opening exchanges, with the Basques successfully pressing their opponents off their game. Luis Enriqueâs men looked particularly vulnerable on their left flank, with Lucas Beraldo â the winter signing from Brazil thrown into the deep end for his first Champions League game â struggling to stave off an electric Takefusa Kubo. PSG did manage to break out of their own half on the counter, but neither MbappÃ© nor DembÃ©lÃ© could trouble Remiro. The best chances came the visitorsâ way, though â AndrÃ© Silvaâs header going narrowly wide before Mikel Merino struck the bar with a long-range effort. That pattern of play would subsist at the start of the second half â until, against the run of play, the hosts broke the deadlock on the hour mark. With Marquinhos nodding on DembÃ©lÃ©âs corner to the back post, MbappÃ© was on hand to finish from close range, for his fourth goal in Europe this season. Bradley Barcola would double the lead twenty minutes from time, finishing off a sweeping counter-attack with a devastating solo effort from the left wing. It was fitting that the summer signing â with his last contribution â would be the one to pull PSG clear. It had been in this competition, against Newcastle, that the worst of this seasonâs criticism came down on him, after a string of wasted chances in that tedious home draw. Having roared back into form over the last few months, the former Lyon man is now a nailed-on starter on PSGâs left wing. With the wind decisively taken out of the Basque sails, Paris Saint-Germain were able to cruise through the last 20 minutes virtually unopposed. Given Real Sociedadâs dominance in the first hour, though, the tie is far from over. PSG player ratings Gianluigi Donnarumma, 6 Achraf Hakimi, 5 Marquinhos, 6 Danilo Pereira, 5 Lucas Beraldo, 3 â Just a month after his arrival from Brazil, the defender was thrown into the deep end of a Champions League knockout tie, and struggled considerably when tasked with staving off Takefusa Kubo. Admittedly, he was being played out of position â the Brazlian Replaced by Lucas HernÃ¡ndez midway through the second half. FabiÃ¡n Ruiz, 6 â The most-improved player between the two halves â the Spaniard turned what was initially a wasteful performance into one where he was able to break up his compatriotsâ play and provide the platform for PSGâs upturn in fortunes at the end of the game. Warren ZaÃ¯re-Emery, 5 Vitinha, 5 Ousmane DembÃ©lÃ©, 6 â The only Paris Saint-Germain player who looked able to break free from the chains of Real Sociedadâs press in the first half, even if the final product was decidedly lacking. As was the case for the rest of the team, a much-improved performance after the break, having been the catalyst for both goals â taking the corner that led to MbappÃ©âs and starting the break that led to Barcolaâs. Kylian MbappÃ©, 7 â The forward was back in the team after being rested at the weekend with an ankle knock, and once again delivered in Europe â he has now scored 9 of PSGâs last 12 Champions League knockout goals. He nearly beat Remiro in one of PSGâs rare bursts forward in the first 45 minutes, and then decisively took charge of the game from his opener onwards. Bradley Barcola, 7 â Saw less of the ball than DembÃ©lÃ© and MbappÃ©, but the 21-year-old continued his impressive run of form by finishing off a sweeping counter-attack to double the lead.","Bradley Barcola, 7 â Saw less of the ball than DembÃ©lÃ© and MbappÃ©, but the 21-year-old continued his impressive run of form by finishing off a sweeping counter-attack to double the lead."
630,Opta supercomputer gives Chelsea less than a 14 per cent chance of shocking City,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Opta-supercomputer-gives-Chelsea-less-than-a-14-per-cent-chance-of-shocking-City/3302791,9 hours ago,"Opta's supercomputer has given Chelsea little hope of pulling off a shock victory at Manchester City this weekend.  Mauricio Pochettino's men travel to the Etihad Stadium after scoring two late goals to beat Crystal Palace 3-1 as they moved back into the top half of the table on Monday night. This followed an impressive victory on the road against Aston Villa in the FA Cup, but the supercomputer is not backing them to pick up a third straight away win. The Blues have been given just a 13.6 per cent chance of winning at City, while Pep Guardiola's are huge favourites, with their win percentage is up at 64. City have won 11 straight games in all competitions to get their season back on track, and they are just two points behind leaders Liverpool with a game in hand.  The Reds travel to Brentford for Saturday's early kick-off looking to extend their advantage over their rivals before they play later in the day. Jurgen Klopp's side have never won at Brentford since the Bees got promoted to the Premier League in 2021, but they have been backed to put that right this time around. The supercomputer rates their chances of winning at 50.3 per cent, while the likelihood of a home win is down at 23.1 per cent. Liverpool could have Mohamed Salah back from injury to help them end their poor run at the Gtech Community Stadium, but will be without Trent Alexander-Arnold after he aggravated a knee injury in last weekend's 3-1 win over Burnley. The Clarets have another tough task on their hands on Saturday afternoon when they host high-flying Arsenal. The Gunners thrashed West Ham 6-0 last Sunday to keep pace with Liverpool and City in the title race, and they are expected to win again at relegation-threatened Burnley. Mikel Arteta's team have a 56 per cent chance of emerging victorious, according to the supercomputer, whereas Burnley have been given an 18.3 per cent chance of picking up three points. Away from the title race, Manchester United have an important away trip to Luton as they look to close in on the top four. Erik ten Hag's men have won four straight games across all competitions to lift the mood at Old Trafford after a disappointing first half of the season, and are now just six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham.    They have been tipped to extend their winning run, but an upset has not been completely ruled out. The Red Devils have a 46.5 per chance of winning, while Luton's win percentage is at 26.5. The Hatters sit just one point above the bottom three heading into this weekend's games, and are likely to be reliant on their home form to get them out of trouble for the remainder of the campaign. They have already beaten Newcastle and Brighton, plus drawn with Liverpool at Kenilworth Road this season, suggesting United may not have things all their own way on Sunday.","They have already beaten Newcastle and Brighton, plus drawn with Liverpool at Kenilworth Road this season, suggesting United may not have things all their own way on Sunday."
631,Liverpool fan Ludvig Aberg has priceless reaction to FSG's Â£2.4bn PGA Tour deal,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Liverpool-fan-Ludvig-Aberg-has-priceless-reaction-to-FSGs-%C2%A32.4bn-PGA-Tour-deal/3302034,1 day ago,"European Ryder Cup starlet and Liverpool fan Ludvig Aberg admitted he was 'devastated' to hear the news that Jurgen Klopp would be departing at the end of the season, but welcome the investment of the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group (FSG) into the PGA Tour.  Aberg has announced himself as golf's hottest prospect since turning professional last June, having recently moved up to No. 11 in the world rankings. His breakthrough comes at a turbulent time for the sport, with the PGA Tour facing competition from their Saudi rivals at LIV Golf. The latest chapter in the saga came last month, when it was announced that Strategic Sports Group (SSG) had agreed to pledge Â£2.4 billion ($3bn) into the newly-formed PGA Tour enterprises. The SSG consortium includes Liverpool owners FSG, who themselves have been in the news in recent weeks away from their golfing investment. This came after the six-time Champions League winners confirmed manager Klopp would leave the club after nine years in the dugout. Echoing the thoughts of the rest of Liverpool's fanbase, Aberg claimed on Wednesday: ""Obviously a couple weeks ago I was pretty devastated when Klopp said he was going to leave, it was one of worst days of my life."" The response came after the youngster was quizzed over FSG's new-found alliance with the PGA Tour. Welcoming the investment of his club's owners, Aberg went on: ""Obviously it's pretty cool, they did a tremendous job with Liverpool and I know they'll do the same on the PGA Tour."" The agreement with SSG has cast doubt over the PGA Tour's proposed peace deal with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF). The American-based circuit has been at war with LIV Golf since the latter's formation in June 2022, but this was expected to come to an end after the Tour announced plans to sign an agreement with PIF. The Saudi-backed league has lured a number of the PGA Tour's big names thanks to its lucrative backing. Aberg himself was offered the chance to sign on the dotted line with the LIV setup on more than on occasion, but turned down the chance to remain with the PGA Tour. Amid the ongoing drama the 24-year-old is keen to focus on the events on the course rather than off it. ""To be honest, I try not to pay that much attention to it,"" he said ahead of this week's Genesis Invitational. ""All of this is still very new to me and I haven't known anything else since I came out here. I actually remember my first day at Canada last year was when they dropped the news of the merger. ""I just don't know anything else and I try not to pay that much attention to it. I just try to play golf and then figure it out from there."" Aberg will be on the hunt for win No. 2 on the PGA Tour in Los Angeles this week, and begins his tournament alongside Nick Hardy and Christiaan Bezuidenhout in the opening two rounds.","""I just don't know anything else and I try not to pay that much attention to it.

632,England stars face a SIX-HOUR coach trip for their Euro 24 game against Denmark,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/England-stars-face-a-SIX-HOUR-coach-trip-for-their-Euro-24-game-against-Denmark/3301300,13 Feb,"Englandâs players are facing a six-hour round trip by coach to reach their European Championship group game against Denmark this summer due to UEFAâs sustainability rules.  UEFA have committed to making this summerâs tournament in Germany the greenest ever and are spending Â£25million on a range of sustainability measures, which includes asking teams to avoid air travel wherever possible. UEFAâs guidance is understood to state that it is reasonable to expect sides to make journeys of around three hours by road or rail in order to cut emissions, although this has not been mandated. Mail Sport has learned that after talks with manager Gareth Southgate the FA have decided to follow UEFAâs directives for Englandâs second group C game against Denmark in Frankfurt, a 180-mile journey from their training camp at the Golfrestort Weimarer Land near Leipzig. Englandâs two other group games in Gelsenkirchen and Cologne, against Serbia and Slovenia respectively, are over four hours away from their base camp by road so coach travel has been deemed impractical.   A three-hour coach journey however is still unusual for elite players, many of whom are accustomed to taking flights lasting a matter of minutes to travel to matches with their clubs. Arsenal were strongly criticised by environmental campaigners for taking a 14-minute flight to Norwich for a Premier League game a few years ago, while other clubs regularly fly short distances, with Manchester United travelling to Leicester City by air for example. The FAâs decision to take a coach trip will add to the playersâ journey time, as the nearest airport to their hotel is just 30 miles away at Erfurt-Weimar, from where it is a 31-minute flight to Frankfurt. As a result the players will be in for a relatively late night given Southgateâs preference to return to base camp immediately after matches so they can recover properly the next day, although the 6pm kick-off should enable them be back at HQ between midnight and 1am. The FA and other competing nations have until 24 February to submit their travel plans to UEFA. Englandâs travel plans for knockout stages have yet to be finalised, although given the distances involved it is unlikely there will be any other coach trips. The only other venue within driving distance of Englandâs hotel is the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which will stage the final, and even that is further than UEFAâs three-hour guidelines.","The only other venue within driving distance of Englandâs hotel is the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which will stage the final, and even that is further than UEFAâs three-hour guidelines."

The Gunners came into the fifth-round contest hoping to bounce back from a first-ever Womenâs Super League loss to West Ham, but could not find the finishing touch at Meadow Park as they crashed out 1-0. A scrappy first half gave way to a more open second period with chances for both sides, WSL leading goalscorer Khadija Shaw seeing two headed efforts kept out, first by Arsenal keeper Sabrina DâAngelo then by defender Leah Williamson in her second start since returning from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament recovery. Shaw, in a worrying sight for City boss Gareth Taylor, was forced off and replaced by Mary Fowler in the 67th minute, shortly before Gunners substitute Steph Catley failed to clear Chloe Kellyâs free-kick and Spain international Aleixandri pounced, poking in the 74th-minute winner. CITY! CITY! CITY! ð©µ pic.twitter.com/vXEhAVjaMZ â Man City Women (@ManCityWomen) February 11, 2024 Khiara Keatingâs stunning series of saves against a late Arsenal surge preserved the visiting sideâs lead, and while the Gunners felt the City keeper had not saved a last-ditch effort from a scramble before it crossed the line, the officials disagreed. Holders Chelsea took one step closer to securing a fourth straight FA Cup crown with a 1-0 victory over Championship side Crystal Palace at Kingsmeadow thanks a superb maiden goal from January signing Mayra Ramirez. Emma Hayes had initially changed all 11 players from the side that beat Sunderland 5-0 in their midweek Conti Cup clash, but Fran Kirby returned as a replacement for Lauren James, who was a late withdrawal from the line-up. It was a valiant performance from Palace, who held the hosts to a goalless draw for 81 minutes, when Ramirez opened her Blues account with a brilliant backheeled flick to book her side another trip into the last eight. Mayra Ramirez  There were wild scenes at Wolverhampton when Beth Merrickâs 67th-minute penalty for Wolves â one of two third-tier sides remaining â cancelled out Katie Robinsonâs first-half opener for relegation-threatened WSL side Brighton. The teams remained on level terms until Emma Kullbergâs first-ever goal forÂ Brighton fired the Seagulls into an 88th-minute lead, before the Sweden international then completed her hat-trick inside a stunning eight minutes. Manchester United, last seasonâs runners-up, claimed a 3-1 victory over Championship outfit Southampton, with Rachel Williams heading home twice after Lexi Lloyd-Smith had cancelled out Ella Tooneâs eighth-minute opener. Kit Grahamâs low, long-range effort in the 76th minute of Tottenhamâs 1-0 victory over Charlton spelled the end of the Championship leadersâ cup run, while goals from Sophie Roman Haug and Melissa Lawley secured Liverpool a 2-0 win over London City Lionesses.","Kit Grahamâs low, long-range effort in the 76th minute of Tottenhamâs 1-0 victory over Charlton spelled the end of the Championship leadersâ cup run, while goals from Sophie Roman Haug and Melissa Lawley secured Liverpool a 2-0 win over London City Lionesses."
635,"Hojlund, Haaland & Rice but who takes top spot in this week's POWER RANKINGS?",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hojlund-Haaland--Rice-but-who-takes-top-spot-in-this-weeks-POWER-RANKINGS/3301370,14 Feb,"Chelsea's 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace rounded out what was another thrilling weekend of Premier League action, as Mauricio Pochettino's side climbed into the top half of the table.  There were also big wins for Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City and Sheffield United, with the Blades triumphing in a relegation six-pointer against Luton. Manchester United continued their improved form with a gutsy 2-1 win against Aston Villa at Villa Park. Indeed, there were no stalemates across any of the 10 fixtures, with Erik ten Hag's side one of six teams to win away from home. The most eye-catching of which came from Arsenal, who put a sorry West Ham to the sword on Sunday afternoon with 6-0 drubbing that signaled their intent to claim a first top-flight title in two decades. Predictably there are a healthy number of Gunners who shone but who takes the top spot in this week's power rankings?  10. Harvey Elliott (new entry) The England Under 21 international has had to make do with a substitutes role this season, starting just three of his 24 Premier League. But Elliott once again showed on Saturday why he is an incredibly important part of a Liverpool squad battling on four fronts. The 20-year-old came on at the break in place of Trent Alexander-Arnold and helped Jurgen Klopp's side wrestle control away from an impressive Burnley side, whose performance stood in contrast to their league position. When he entered the fray, the game was tied at one apiece but by the end of his afternoon's work Liverpool had earned themselves a much-needed 3-1 win. Elliott was involved in both the goals that saw the Reds return to the Premier League summit, including a brilliant cross for Darwin Nunez that clinched the win.  9. Rasmus Hojlund (new entry) The young Danish striker is evidence of the power of confidence. Hojlund was made to wait until Boxing Day for his first Premier League goal but now he has five in his last five. On Sunday, the 21-year-old popped up with an archetypal striker's finish, scoring smartly after Harry Maguire's header had fallen to him in the six-yard area. Since Hojlund has started scoring Manchester United are unbeaten, winning four with the only dropped points coming in a 2-2 draw against Tottenham last month. Hojlund was not as involved at Villa Park as he has been in recent outings - his goal was the only shot he had on target. However, for his clinical display and continued goalscoring, he earns a place on the list.  8. Rodrigo Muniz (new entry) Fulham signed the Brazilian forward from Flamengo ahead of the 2021-22 Championship season, with the expectation that he would challenge Mitrovic for a starting spot. However, his first campaign left a lot to be desired before he was loaned out to Middlesbrough last term and endured an even more lacklustre 12 months. But with the Cottagers, the 22-year-old finally looks ready to deliver to the promise of his signing, with three goals in his last two Premier League games, including a brace in the weekend's win over Bournemouth. Two poacher's goals will have given everyone in west London hope that they have finally found the replacement for their old Serbian hero.  7. Conor Gallagher (new entry) Conor Gallagher waited until his return to Selhurst Park to grab his first Premier League goals of the season and they were anything but academic. The 24-year-old's brace helped Chelsea respond from back-to-back league defeats and perfectly highlighted his importance to Mauricio Pochettino's team. The England international arrived onto the scene at the most opportune moment in both instances and produced clinical one-touch finishes which gave Dean Henderson no chance in the Eagles' net. Gallagher also boasted an 86 per cent passing accuracy, two interceptions and three key passes from his evening's work.  6. Andre Onana (new entry) Andre Onana might actually be a decent goalkeeper. Well, that's at least what he's been showing in recent weeks. Evidence prior to that was not particularly kind on the Cameroonian. The former Inter Milan stopper has had more than a couple high profile errors this term but he appears to have sorted a few things out as the Red Devils have crafted a good run of results. Onana has the third highest number of saves in the division this term and the third-highest save percentage, behind only Alphonse Areola and Alisson Becker. Against Villa, he added eight to his tally of denials and had an xG prevented of 1.56. His often lauded quality - ball playing - took a back seat as he thwarted Unai Emery's team at crucial moments of the win.  5. Bruno Guimaraes (new entry) Guimaraes might have made it onto the power rankings on the quality of his goals alone. His first against Nottingham Forest was an audacious volley with the outside of his boot, albeit from close range. Still, it required the technique many, even at the top level, would struggle to find. The Brazilian's second was a much more straightforward attempt that was created with the poise and composure we have come to expect from the former Lyon midfielder. Goals aside, Guimaraes was a major factor in the win for Eddie Howe's side at the City Ground. He completed 42 of his 48 passes, won six of his nine ground duals and also chipped in with a vital block. That's now four goal involvements in four games for the 26-year-old, having registered three in his previous 20.  4. Martin Odegaard (new entry) Arsenal have returned from the winter break with a point to prove. Four games played, four wins, 16 goals scored and Odegaard has been at the centre of much of their good work. On Sunday he provided two assists in the Hammers' hammering, enjoying 123 touches and completing an otherworldly 109 of his 115 passes. The Gunners skipper also produced seven key passes, won all three of his ground duels and even had a successful dribble in there for good measure. With a performance like that, surely he was the best player on the pitch at the London Stadium, right? Right?  3. Erling Haaland (new entry) Erling Haaland's previous two outings after returning from injury raised the admittedly ludicrous possibility that he might not be the same player. Though, those prediction were in hope from City's Premier League rivals rather than any concrete evidence. Saturday's display put paid to all of that. Especially his second goal, in which he shrugged off the equally sizeable and highly-touted Jarrad Branthwaite before calmly sliding his shot past Jordan Pickford. The Norwegian had been out of action for over a month but was still able to return as the league's leading scorer. He added a couple of goals distance between himself and Mohamed Salah to give him 16 in 18 Premier League appearances.  2. Declan Rice (new entry) Declan Rice has had to endure two defeats to his former club since moving to Arsenal, a fact compounded by his worst performance for the north Londoners which came in the 2-0 defeat to the Hammers in December. All niceties were gone on Sunday, well, aside from his decision not to celebrate his goal, as Rice absolutely dominated the game at the London Stadium. His delivery from a set-piece is often overlooked amid his multitude of other qualities. But on the weekend he laid on two exquisite deliveries before scoring a stunner to twist the knife into his former side. Add to that his four key passes, 93 per cent passing accuracy and two big chances created and you have a supreme display from one of the best midfielders on the planet.  1. Bukayo Saka (new entry) No one was more thankful for Arsenal's short hiatus than Saka, who looked like he had been running on empty for weeks ahead of the break. Since returning, Saka has four goals and one assists in four games, with his performance against David Moyes's side the pick of his outings.  The England international bagged a brace - the second coming after a trademark mazy shimmy inside before a pinpoint finish.

636,La Liga surprised at Jude Bellingham-Mason Greenwood disciplinary process,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/La-Liga-surprised-at-Jude-Bellingham-Mason-Greenwood-disciplinary-process/3301790,2 days ago,"Real Madrid against Getafe on a Thursday night at the Coliseum rarely makes global headlines, but Jude Bellingham is more than used to them, and his clash with Manchester United loanee Mason Greenwood filled many. The former appeared to call Greenwood a ârapistâ during the game, as was caught by the TV cameras, and a disciplinary process was opened at the request of Getafe.  The request itself came as a surprise to Real Madrid and La Liga. A lip-reader has been hired to determine whether Bellingham did indeed say what he is alleged to have done, and a report has been submitted to the Competition Committee, who will decide whether to sanction the Real Madrid star. Greenwood himself was surprised by the matter, and the report details that he and his camp were keen not to take things any further themselves. The process will take a few weeks, and then there will be a period of 10 days for both sides to submit evidence in the case, followed by a further period of appeal. It means the sanction may not be ratified, if there is one, until well into March, say Marca. That could be a problem for Bellingham, should the sanction be grave. They face Barcelona on the 21st of April, and he will be desperate to be at the Bernabeu for it. Teams have a tacit agreement not to report issues or insults between players that occur on the pitch, say the Madrid-based daily, hence the bewilderment from La Liga and Real Madrid at Getafeâs insistence. It continues a curious history between the pair since both arrived in Spain, with reports initially that Greenwood had spoken to Bellingham about coming to Spain. This was spoken publicly by Getafe manager Jose Bordalas, who then apologised publicly for making a mistake, by all accounts, at the behest of Bellinghamâs camp.","It continues a curious history between the pair since both arrived in Spain, with reports initially that Greenwood had spoken to Bellingham about coming to Spain.

637,West Ham 0-6 Arsenal: Gunners thrash Hammers with Saka's brace & Rice's goal,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/West-Ham-0-6-Arsenal-Gunners-thrash-Hammers-with-Sakas-brace--Rices-goal/3299262,11 Feb,"Bukayo Saka scored twice and Declan Rice found the net against his old club as Arsenal flexed their muscles in the title race with a thumping 6-0 win at West Ham.  The Gunnersâ title bid hit the buffers in this fixture last season when they blew a two-goal lead to draw 2-2. There was no chance of a repeat after William Saliba headed them in front and West Ham promptly collapsed. William Saliba, centre, scores Arsenal  Rice grabbed a pair of assists on his return to his former manor while Saka, Gabriel Magalhaes and Leandro Trossard were also on target, all before half-time. Saka scored his second midway through the second half and Rice rubbed salt in the wounds with a long-range sixth. When West Ham beat Arsenal and Manchester United in December, there was talk of a Champions League challenge in these parts. They have lost to both in the past eight days, shipping nine goals in the process, and are still without a win in 2024. Alarm bells might not be ringing for manager David Moyes just yet, but the sight of hundreds of West Ham fans leaving at half-time told a sorry tale. Empty seats in the stand as West Ham fans leave early during defeat to Arsenal  The opening goal arrived after 32 minutes when Rice, getting plenty of stick from the home fans, swung in a corner. Saliba outjumped Edson Alvarez at the far post and, with Ben White blocking goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, planted a free header into the net. Saka hit the second from the penalty spot after he burst clear and was brought down by Areola. After a lengthy VAR check for offside, the spot-kick was confirmed and Saka confidently sent Areola the wrong way. Four minutes later Rice came up with assist number two, swinging in a free-kick which Gabriel, on his 150th Gunners appearance, headed home in front of a lumbering Kurt Zouma. And in first-half stoppage time Arsenal struck again, Martin Odegaard feeding Trossard to curl home number four. It was Arsenalâs 8,000th league goal, and they were already well on the way to 9,000 by full-time. Bukayo Saka, left, scores Arsenalâs fifth goal  Number 8,001 arrived in the 62nd minute when Saka cut inside Nayef Aguerd and lashed his shot past Areola. Then came Riceâs big moment, the former Hammers skipper curling in from 25 yards after Trossard and Odegaard left the ball to each other, before performing the obligatory non-celebration in front of Arsenalâs elated fans. Rice got a standing ovation from the home crowd when he left the field moments later, probably because those supporters had little else to clap on a painful day for the east Londoners and a bumper afternoon for Arsenal. 0' The match is about to start!  9' Yellow Card!

638,Bruno Guimaraes double fires Newcastle past Nottingham Forest,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Bruno-Guimaraes-double-fires-Newcastle-past-Nottingham-Forest/3298961,11 Feb,"Bruno Guimaraes scored his first goals since September as Newcastle gave their hopes of qualifying for Europe a shot in the arm with an entertaining 3-2 win at Nottingham Forest. The Brazilian had not scored since the 8-0 rout at Sheffield United in September but opened the scoring at the City Ground and then netted the winner in the second half. Fabian Schar also scored as the Magpies moved seventh, two points behind sixth-placed Manchester United, and after an inconsistent season they will now be eyeing a run of form which sees them book European football for a second successive season. Bruno Guimaraes celebrates his winning goal against Nottingham Forest  Forest twice drew level through Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi and thought they should have had a penalty at 2-2, but they are still searching for a first Premier League win of 2024 and are just two points above the relegation zone. And with a possible points deduction from the Premier League hanging over their heads, there will be real concerns going into the final third of the season. Their cause is not helped by continually losing games they are competing in as this was the sixth time they have lost 3-2 this season. The tone for a breathless match was set in the fifth minute as Forest could have led from an excellent chance for Morgan Gibbs-White. Taiwo Awoniyi surged forward and played in Nuno Tavares to cut back for Gibbs-White, who whistled a left-footed effort just past the post. Five minutes later the hosts were behind as Guimaraes ghosted in at the far post to produce a fine first-time finish from Kieran Trippierâs deep cross. Bruno Guimaraes, background right, scores the opening goal  Newcastle defender Dan Burn was given a chastening afternoon by Luton speedster Chiedozie Ogbene last week so will have not have been thrilled at the prospect of coming up against Elanga. And the long-legged defender was left in the dust by the Sweden international as Nicolas Dominguezâs through-ball sent him clear, but Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka stayed big and made a good stop. Elanga was not so wasteful with his next chance 10 minutes later as he again put on the afterburners to leave Burn and Sven Botman in his wake, coolly slotting through Dubravkaâs legs from Gibbs-Whiteâs excellent through-ball. Forest were pushing for a second but Newcastle regained the lead in the 43rd minute. Botman headed down Trippierâs free-kick into the path of Schar, who guided the ball cleanly into the bottom corner from 12 yards. It was 2-2 in the sixth minute of first-half added time as Hudson-Odoi cut inside from the left and let fly with an effort that clipped Lewis Miley and soared into the corner. Callum Hudson-Odoi, right, celebrates with fellow goalscorer Anthony Elanga  Forest continued to have joy against Newcastleâs high line and thought they should have had a penalty just after the hour. Awoniyi raced through on goal from Matz Selsâ long kick and looked to be tripped by Dubravkaâs outstretched arm, but referee Anthony Taylor did not give a penalty and VAR did not overrule despite a check. Typically, three minutes later Newcastle went ahead for the third time as Elangaâs loose pass went straight to Guimaraes, who found the bottom corner for his second of the night. This time Newcastle did not relinquish their advantage and saw it out for a valuable three points.",This time Newcastle did not relinquish their advantage and saw it out for a valuable three points.

Mourinho is currently out of work after he was sacked by Roma last month. However, the 61-year-old has been linked with Bayern, with Thomas Tuchel having received much criticism from supporters recently. According to BILD, Mourinho is keen on taking charge of Bayern if the opportunity arises. Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen has backed Tuchel following the 3-0 defeat to Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen.  'Nothing changes,' Dressen told BILD. 'We knew beforehand that it would be a difficult game. We would have liked a different result. We are concentrating on the next games. 'I don't like to repeat myself (about Tuchel's future), it remains as I just said.' Mourinho won the Europa Conference League with Roma in 2022 but was sacked after some inconsistent performances this campaign. The former Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid manager is eager to get back into management. Mourinho has previously managed in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain. ",

The Blues are currently searching for Hayes' replacement after the Englishwoman announced she was leaving the club in the summer to become the new USWNT coach. Bompastor was earmarked as a potential successor early in the process given her achievements as both a player and manager and negotiations are now ongoing, as reported by The Athletic. Her current contract runs until 2025 and Chelsea are working to secure her exit before the end of the existing deal. The French-born manager previously won the Women's Champions League as a player before going on to achieve the same feat as Lyon coach two-years ago.  She was promoted to her current role from within Lyon having previously worked in the club's academy prior to Jean-Luc Vasseur being sacked in 2021. Her first season was rewarded with Lyon winning an outstanding double consisting of the Division 1 Feminine and the Womenâs Champions League where the club beat Barcelona in the final. Bompastor's attack-minded philosophy has resulted in Lyon becoming one of the women game's most-feared teams after previously winning the league with an unbeaten record during her first full season in charge. Hayes and Bompastor are manager's cut from the same cloth after previously working alongside each other in America during their formative coaching years over a decade ago. The current Chelsea boss was on the coaching team at Washington Freedom in the Womenâs Professional Soccer championship, while Bompastor has just joined the newly-formed American team's squad.   Hayes has been incredibly impressed with the 43-year-old since they first met, previously stating before a quarter-final Champions League clash with Lyon: âWhat a brilliant player, honestly. An unbelievable left-back with an unbelievable wand of a left boot. 'I managed to coach her in a team that had Homare Sawa and Abby Wambach. She was just a cultured, brilliant footballer thatâs very quiet, cheeky, funny â the media might not always see that about her. âBut itâs of no surprise to me that her and Camille have done well working together and I said to her at the end of the game last week: âround one, Iâll see you back at Stamford Bridge next weekâ. âThis will be a tough match and we both have a lot of respect for each other and itâs one that Iâm looking forward to even more,' she said at the time.","âThis will be a tough match and we both have a lot of respect for each other and itâs one that Iâm looking forward to even more,' she said at the time."

Previously, the 26-year-old admitted that joining the Blaugrana would be a âdream moveâ, comments that angered fans and officials at current club Girona, where he has been in sensational form this season.  Barcelona tried for Garcia in January, but their ongoing financial woes meant that a deal was not possible. However, they look set to try again in the summer, although again, it was depend on whether it is affordable. Garcia was asked about the Barcelona links at an event on Wednesday, as per Sport. He was much less reversed on this occasion, which is sure to please Girona following the events of a few months ago. âI donât think they have my number. When you play well, you attract a lot of teams and rumours start to come out. At the end of the season everything will be dealt with.â Garcia also commented on the comparisons between Michel Sanchez, his manager at Girona, and the legendary Pep Guardiola. âThey are passionate about football, they haveÂ a lotÂ of similarities. Michel learns a lot from Pep, they areÂ in contact because they are part of the same group.â It remains to be seen whether Barcelona do try to sign Garcia this summer. He would be an excellent addition to their midfield department, although it would be rather bloated if he does join.","It remains to be seen whether Barcelona do try to sign Garcia this summer.

643,'I prefer not to speak': Mourinho reacts to criticism of Arteta's celebrations,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/I-prefer-not-to-speak-Mourinho-reacts-to-criticism-of-Artetas-celebrations/3298721,11 Feb,"Jose Mourinho has given his verdict on the criticism that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has received for 'over-celebrating'.  Arteta was jubilant following Arsenal's 3-1 win at home to Liverpool last weekend and made no secret of his emotions at the final whistle. Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard was also seen taking a photo of the club's photographer Stuart MacFarlane. The Arsenal celebrations prompted criticism from pundit Jamie Carragher and sparked much debate on social media as to whether the Gunners had been celebrating excessively. Carragher said on Sky Sports: 'Just get down the tunnel. You've won a game, three points, you've been brilliant. Back in the title race, get down the tunnel. I'm serious, honestly.'    Mourinho has now weighed into the debate and it's clear that the former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United boss is in favour of managers celebrating. He made reference to his famous quote, 'I prefer not to speak'. Mourinho wrote on Instagram: 'What do I think of managers' celebrations after a victory?' 'I prefer not to speak.' In addition, Mourinho posted a collage of some of his most famous celebrations, including when he ran down the touchline at Old Trafford in 2004 when he was Porto boss. The images also included Mourinho shushing a TV camera in a riposte to critics of his Manchester United team in 2017 following a victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Another of Mourinho's memorable celebrations came in 2010 when his Inter Milan side knocked Barcelona out of the Champions League at the semi-finals stage. In 2018 Mourinho, then in charge of Manchester United, cupped his ear to Juventus fans after a Champions League game. Arteta, meanwhile, insisted that he wasn't aware that Arsenal's celebrations had caused such a storm. Arteta said: âThe club told me today, I didnât know anything about it,â he said. âI love it. Iâve seen managers at the Emirates on their knees. Personally, I love it because it brings a passion to the game when itâs done in a natural and unique way.â ",

Scott McTominay was brought off the bench and scored the winning goal four minutes from time after meeting Diogo Dalot's superb cross and nodding home. A defeat for United would have moved them 11 points adrift of the top four but Rasmus Hojlund settled any nerves after tucking home the opener just yards out. Douglas Luiz's quick thinking found the equaliser for Villa, however, after the visitors failed to clear their lines from a goalmouth scramble on 67 minutes. But substitute McTominay later rescued United's listing campaign and here, Mail Sport's IAN LADYMAN has rated both sets of players from Villa Park...  MANCHESTER UNITED ANDRE ONANA 8.5 Two fabulous first half saves kept United in front during a spell of intense Villa pressure. Continued in same vein after the break. Starting to look like a United goalkeeper at last.  DIOGO DALOT 6 Struggled with the Villa raids down his side. Too often exposed for pace on the turn. Never found wanting for effort and great cross for the winner. HARRY MAGUIRE 8 Continuing to enjoy his renaissance at United. Did the simple things well and although he is no longer captain he has emerged as a leader. Superb.  RAFAEL VARANE 6 Needed his goalkeeper to help him cover a couple of times in the first half as Villa played quick balls beyond him. Still reads the game terrifically well. LUKE SHAW 6 Only managed 45 minutes and United will hope he is not badly hurt. Erik Ten Hag needs a settled back four and he needs Shaw to be part of it. CASEMIRO â 5.5 Needs young Kobbie Mainoo's legs beside him to do his running. Will improve with more games but here he was not at his best. Too many misplaced passes. KOBBIE MAINOO 6.5 The find of the season for United and will learn from afternoons like this, when the opposition control large parts of the game. Worked manfully, won plenty of duels but needed help.  ALEJANDRO GARNACHO 6.5 Much improved in terms of decision making and final pass. A threat down the United right on the counter. Needs to find that end product more often. BRUNO FERNANDES 6 Struggled to impact the game as his team found it hard to enjoy extended possession. Needed a better platform behind him. MARCUS RASHFORD 5.5 Seems engaged once more and threatened with a couple of runs down the left. Fluffed one chance he made for himself. Fitful, though. RASMUS HOJLUND 7 Goals are flowing now and though he would benefit from better service, he worried Villa here on the counter. Improving.  SUBSTITUTIONS VICTOR LINDELOF (on for Shaw 45) 5 Gave ball away with just about first touch and Onana bailed him out. Looked miles off at times. SCOTT MCTOMINAY (on for Rashford 73mins) 8 Sent on to save the game and won the game. What a header. JONNY EVANS (on for Hojlund 90mins) SOFYAN AMRABAT (on for Mainoo 90mins) ASTON VILLA EMILIANO MARTINEZ 6 Had no chance with either United opening goal. Strangely, didn't have that much to do. MATTY CASH 5.5 An afternoon to concentrate up against Marcus Rashford but was rarely beaten or exposed. Bullied by McTominay for the winner.  DIEGO CARLOS 6 Dealt with the pace of the United attack well. Rarely beaten in the air. CLEMENT LENGLET 6 Played a part in Villa's equaliser and looked composed as Villa built play from the back. ALEX MORENO 6 An important cog in Villa's attacking machine down the left but struggled at times to contain Alejandro Garnacho in his own half. BOUBACAR KAMARA 6.5 Powerful and intelligent in midfield. Much of the prompting behind Villa's thrusts in the attacking third came from him. DOUGLAS LUIZ 7 Such an important player for Villa. Does the simple things well and keeps the ball moving. Influential. Big chance at 1-1 but couldn't make firm enough contact.  LEON BAILEY 7.5 Dangerous and direct whenever he gets the ball in wide positions. Curled a good chance wide when could have done better during a spell of early Villa dominance.  JACOB RAMSEY 7 Back from injury and looking sharp. Having him in the team will be important in the run-in. Unlucky that Maguire blocked one goal bound shot. JOHN MCGINN 7.5 First half shot almost broke Onana's fingers and his passing and prompting oozed intelligence as always. His energy levels rarely dipped. Best passer on the field. OLLIE WATKINS 6.5 Played Hojlund onside for United opener and should do better than that. Troubled United's central defensive pairing with his clever darts in and behind them. Will play worse and score.  SUBSTITUTIONS MOUSSA DIABY (on for Kamara 64mins) 6 Brought freshness but couldn't make decisive contributions. YOURI TIELEMANS (on for Bailey 73mins) 6 Should be asking himself why he hasn't managed to get a place in this team.

The Gunners had been eyeing a response after losing to Mackenzie Arnold and Katrina Gorry's West Ham in the Women's Super League. But Catley in particular had a day to forget, coming off the bench in the 67th minute before her failed clearance seven minutes later opened the door for Spain international Aleixandri to score the winner. Arsenal were then denied over and over by 19-year-old City goalkeeper Khiara Keating's stunning late series of saves. The Gunners were also incensed when they believed the City keeper had not saved a last-ditch effort from a scramble before it crossed the line, but the officials disagreed. 'It's super frustrating, especially when I feel like there were really good moments for us and we were on top, especially that second half,' Foord, who started along with Cooney-Cross, told Optus Sport. 'We created a lot, but all credit to their keeper, she had a 'worldie' today and pulled off some really good saves. 'But we had plenty of chances to get back into the game and stay in it. 'We're playing good football, it's just the results and I guess decisions aren't going our way at times, which is becoming super frustrating.'   Mary Fowler came off the bench for City, replacing injured striker Bunny Shaw in the 67th minute. Alanna Kennedy was brought on in injury-time to close out the game and seal progression to the quarter-finals. Arsenal, who sit third in the WSL, will turn their focus to a League Cup quarter-final against the London City Lionesses, before a league blockbuster against Manchester United. 'They're massive games and we know the challenge ahead,' Foord said. 'We can't drop points from now on. 'We want to win that trophy in the (League) Cup and give ourselves the best chance in the league and that's to win every game from now on and just focus on ourselves 'I guess it's in our hands now to stay in it.' Sam Kerr's replacement at Chelsea, Colombia forward Mayra Ramirez, scored her first goal for her new club to steer the Blues to a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace.

The Portuguese manager, recently of Roma, has been hit with a hefty fine by the Spanish tax authorities, although he presumably has enough saved away to take the hit.  Mourinho had an open case which he had appealed for tax evasion from the period of 2010-12 when he was employed by Real Madrid. His appeal has been turned down by the Supreme Court, as per Relevo, and he will be forced to pay a â¬571k fine, in addition to a settlement of â¬881k, amounting to over â¬1.45m in total. While he escaped charges for the year of 2010, the tax authorities did find that he did not pay the correct amount of tax for the years of 2011 and 2012. He alleged that Real Madrid were paying the agency fees to Jorge Mendesâ Gestifute out of his wages, rather than him. That has not been upheld though, and Mourinho becomes the latest high-profile figure in Spain to fall foul of the taxman. Image via Odd ANDERSEN / AFP",Image via Odd ANDERSEN / AFP

As such, Morata could be back for the return leg of Atletico's Champions League quarterfinal against Inter Milan.","As such, Morata could be back for the return leg of Atletico's Champions League quarterfinal against Inter Milan."
650,Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reflects on 'sour' ending to Ronaldo's time at Man United,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer-reflects-on-sour-ending-to-Ronaldos-time-at-Man-United/3301770,2 days ago,"Former Man United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reflected on the 'sad' and 'sour' end to Cristiano Ronaldo's second spell at United - but insisted the club made the 'right decision' to bring him back from Juventus in 2021.  The Red Devils secured a fairytale comeback for the Portuguese forward, who had initially left for Real Madrid in an Â£80million deal in 2009, and the veteran enjoyed an incredible first season back in the Premier League as he thumped in 24 goals in 18 games in all competitions. But Ronaldo went from being United's talisman under Solskjaer to an outcast under his successor Erik ten Hag, who repeatedly left him out of his starting XIs, before the legendary five-time Ballon d'Or winner came under fire for storming out of Old Trafford early before the end of games. Amid huge speculation Ronaldo could end his spell early, pressed self-destruct by taking part in a sensational tell-all interview with Piers Morgan in November 2022, where he claimed he felt 'betrayed' by the club - while saying he 'doesn't respect' Ten Hag. But despite the toxic ending to Ronaldo's spell, Solskjaer believes the club made the right call the bring him back after the 'unbelievable' scenes that his initial move brought.  'Cristiano wanted to leave Juventus but we didn't think it was possible to bring him back. We had built a squad without Cristiano,' Solskjaer told the Times of India. 'And then when this opportunity came, I think everyone in the world thought it's going to be fantastic. And he had a good season. I think he scored 28 goals. 'His first outing on return was against Newcastle. I think there have not been many days at Old Trafford that have seen a better vibe. And it was an unbelievable thing. So, it's about giving people memories. That's a memory for everyone who was there, and that he came back after having been the best player in the world for so many years.' Solskjaer - who was sacked by United in November 2021 - midway through Ronaldo's first season back - hailed the player's attitude and rued how things turned 'sour' for Ronaldo, being left frustrated to see how things fell apart after he himself had left the club. 'I love Cristiano's professional attitude. But it didn't work out for him,' he added. 'It didn't work out for me. It didn't work out for the team, unfortunately. But at that moment, it was the right decision to welcome him back to Old Trafford. That's life. We made a decision.'   'So, unfortunately, after I left, it turned sour with Cristiano. It was sad to see from the outside.' Solskjaer was a popular figure at United after stabilising the club from the turbulent reign of Jose Mourinho, but failed to improve United as a whole before being replaced by Ralf Rangnick initially, and with Ten Hag taking over the following summer. Ronaldo, meanwhile, agreed to leave United by mutual consent midway through his second season, just weeks after giving his explosive interview, with the club confirming the news in a 67-word statement. Just over a month later, Ronaldo would secure an eye-watering Â£175m-a-year deal with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Nassr - kicking off a revolution of high-profile players who would join him in the country's top division for vast sums of money.","Just over a month later, Ronaldo would secure an eye-watering Â£175m-a-year deal with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Nassr - kicking off a revolution of high-profile players who would join him in the country's top division for vast sums of money."

Thauvin had only joined Lille that year after he was picked up by the club in January for â¬3.5 million from SC Bastia. As part of the deal for the future World Cup winner, Lille immediately loaned him back to Bastia, and Thauvin carried on his impressive form collecting the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award for the 2012/13 season. In the summer, despite not yet playing for Lille, the club looked to make a huge profit from Marseilleâs interest in the winger, as he explains, âFrÃ©dÃ©ric Paquet (the ex-Lille Sporting Director) summoned me and tells me âfor â¬8 million weâll let you go.ââ Thauvin continues, âI tell Marseille and they offer â¬8 million but Lille refuse. Paquet comes to me and says for â¬10 million itâll happen. Marseille offer â¬10 million and Lille refuse again. For â¬12 million theyâll let me go. Marseille offer this amount and Lille still rejects the offer.â Thauvin was frustrated by this situation stating âPaquet catches me in the corridor and tells me the news. And I told him âItâs simple, Iâm done.â I gathered my belongings in a rubbish bag and put them in my car, and I never came back.â On deadline day, Lille relented and sold the winger to Marseille for â¬15 million making a clear profit on a player who never played for them. However, Thauvin believes he was unfairly characterised as Lille fans were furious at his perceived lack of respect, âThey made me look like the bad guy, but I was used as a bargaining chip. I never played for the club and they made â¬10 million on me.â","On deadline day, Lille relented and sold the winger to Marseille for â¬15 million making a clear profit on a player who never played for them.

652,Liverpool send scouts to watch Alonso in action - and two of his best players,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Liverpool-send-scouts-to-watch-Alonso-in-action---and-two-of-his-best-players/3300925,13 Feb,"Xabi Alonso has emerged as a top target for Liverpool when Jurgen Klopp leaves his post as manager at the end of the season, with Kop scouts taking in his side's weekend thrashing of Bayern Munich.  Alonso is the current favourite to replace Klopp after the impressive start he has made to his managerial career, while his status as a fan favourite at Anfield after spending five years at the club as a player doesn't hurt his cause either. His Bayer Leverkusen side destroyed Harry Kane's Bayern at the BayArena on Saturday, to extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points. And, as first reported by HITC, Liverpool sent scouts to the game to monitor Alonso in his biggest game to date as a manager - as well as two of his Leverkusen stars. That duo, it's understood, are Ecuador international centre-back Piero Hincapie and Germany star Florian Wirtz. Liverpool were first linked with left-footed defender Hincapie last summer, with the player's agent Manuel Sierra confirming the Reds' interest. ""Liverpool were interested in him, but at that time they chose to invest in the midfield,"" Sierra said, as per the Liverpool Echo. ""It will not be less than Â£50million."" Sierra later clarified his comments back in October, claiming there are several other clubs also interested in Hincapie. ""I was directly asked about Liverpool's interest in Piero Hincapie, and of course they like him, but I never said they made a serious offer or will do so in January,"" he said. ""Lots of clubs are looking at him because he's a young and interesting talent but he is focused on Leverkusen for now."" Liverpool have been keeping tabs on a number of left-sided centre-backs - something they don't currently have in their squad - as they prepare for life after Virgil van Dijk, the club captain who is into his 30s and the final 18 months of his current big-money deal. Wirtz, who has scored eight goals and provided 15 assists in 29 appearances across all competitions so far this season was particularly impressive in the win over Bayern. Alonso has previously compared him to Lionel Messi. ""There are good players and there are players who look good on the pitch,"" Alonso said in January. ""The player who looks good does things that are nice, but not necessarily efficient. Why is Messi so good? Because he knows how and when to play simple passes. ""Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball!' It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest. Florian can do that. That's why he's so good.""","""Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball!' It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest.

McTominay stepped off the bench to make a crucial contribution for the third time this season as he headed a late winner to give United a 2-1 win at Aston Villa. Ten Hagâs side are now five points behind Villa and six behind fourth-placed Tottenham. âItâs a massive win for us,â said Ten Hag. âWe've got closer, that was absolutely our target and we've done it. âWe can beat any opponent away or home, but sometimes away we have to believe it more. Itâs about belief and this team today believed we could win.â  On match-winner McTominay, he added: âThere are not many players who can come from the bench and bring this energy and contribute to the team. âScott is an example for many other players, always giving the spirit and always doing the right things. He is ready for one minute or for minute 90, he is always ready.

Before half-time against Sevilla he went off with what looked like it could be a serious knee injury, ending up on the bench in tears and with a swollen knee.  However Marca say that Morata will be out for only two to three weeks. The 31-year-old striker has suffered bruising on his knee bone, and a strain of his knee ligaments, but is expected to recover some time towards the end of the month or the start of the match. He will miss their Champions League Round of 16 first leg against Inter in Milan, as well as La Liga clashes with Las Palmas (H) and Almeria (A). His presence in the Copa del Rey second leg is up in the air, as they face Athletic Club at San Mames in 17 days time, hoping to overturn a 1-0 deficit. He will likely be fit for their next tie against Real Betis at home in the league. Memphis Depay is the obvious replacement for Morata, and he has been in fine form in 2024, scoring and assisting at a rate that is higher than a goal per game. Yet his style of play is rather different from that of Morata, and should Simeone want to prioritise shape without the ball, he will no doubt call on Angel Correa to replace Morata in the big games.","Memphis Depay is the obvious replacement for Morata, and he has been in fine form in 2024, scoring and assisting at a rate that is higher than a goal per game.

659,Man Utd may be forced to rethink Ten Hag's double transfer plan thanks to Alonso,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-Utd-may-be-forced-to-rethink-Ten-Hags-double-transfer-plan-thanks-to-Alonso/3301165,13 Feb,"Manchester United have identified Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba as summer transfer targets - but their chances of doing a deal could be impacted by Liverpool's interest in Xabi Alonso.  Despite failing to make a single signing during the January transfer window, Erik ten Hag is expected to be backed in the summer and a defensive overhaul is on his agenda. Not only are there question marks over the long-term futures of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Raphael Varane and Victor Lindelof - while Jonny Evans is set to leave when his contract expires - United are keeping tabs on Frimpong and Tapsoba with a view to firming up their interest at the end of the current campaign. As first reported by The Manchester Evening News the duo's impressive form at Leverkusen, who are top of the Bundesliga after going unbeaten so far this term and having thrashed Bayern Munich at the weekend, has not gone unnoticed at Old Trafford. Interest in Frimpong initially emerged back in January with Ten Hag understood to be keen on signing a right-back ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Diogo Dalot has impressed in recent weeks but they're looking to strengthen with Wan-Bissaka likely to be sold as he enters the final year of his contract. Strengthening at centre-back is also on United's agenda with Varane and Evans both due to become free agents in the summer. Lindelof could also yet be sold despite extending his deal for a further year and Tapsoba has been identified as a potential replacement. While it remains to be seen if acquiring both players would be financially viable - particularly as they look to also add in other areas - United's chances of doing a deal for the defensive duo are also likely to be complicated by Liverpool's interest in Alonso. The former Reds midfielder has been heavily touted as the ideal candidate to replace Anfield chief Jurgen Klopp, who announced last month that he would be standing down from his role at the end of the season. Alonso, 42, has earned plenty of plaudits for the impressive body of work he has achieved at Leverkusen who are now five points clear at the Bundesliga summit. And if Liverpool do decide that Alonso is the man to replace Klopp on Merseyside, then any potential transfer activity at Leverkusen would be delayed, with sporting director Simon Rolfes - who insists Alonso could stay put at the BayArena this summer - keen to let the club's head coach have their say on who stays and who goes.","And if Liverpool do decide that Alonso is the man to replace Klopp on Merseyside, then any potential transfer activity at Leverkusen would be delayed, with sporting director Simon Rolfes - who insists Alonso could stay put at the BayArena this summer - keen to let the club's head coach have their say on who stays and who goes."

It was a dream start for Los Blancos, as they took the lead inside six minutes. And what a goal it was too, as Vinicius Junior rifled home from 25 yards, leaving Paulo Gazzaniga with absolutely no chance. Vinicius then turned provider for the second, as his exquisite pass played in Jude Bellingham, who rounded Gazzaniga before slotting into the empty net to make it 2-0 just after the half hour mark. Real Madrid continued their dominance in the second period, and they managed to add a third on 54 minutes. Brilliant work from Vinicius saw him get a shot off inside the Girona penalty area, Gazzaniga could only palm into the path of Bellingham, who added his second goal of the evening â and 20th of the season. It got even better for the hosts as they added a fourth soon after. Vinicius robbed Yan Couto, before playing in Rodrygo to score his first goal in six matches. It could have got even better too, but Joselu Mato missed a late penalty, which was won by Arda Guler. The result means that Real Madrid have now established a somewhat comfortable lead in the La Liga table. Girona will look to put this one behind them quickly, and they are still six points ahead of Barcelona in second â albeit having played a game more.","The result means that Real Madrid have now established a somewhat comfortable lead in the La Liga table.

United have been accused of employing a scattergun approach to signing players over the past decade, paying far too much for star names without following a clear strategy. Man United are expected to reach an agreement with Newcastle to make Ashworth their new sporting director as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos make changes behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Ashworth, 52, has built a strong reputation in the transfer market following stints at Brighton and Newcastle, following years of work with the Football Association. Former United captain Keane believes his old club may finally get it right when it comes to signings.  'The way Brighton have done it with their recruitment, and Newcastle, recruitment is key,' Keane told the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet. 'Manchester United have had many issues over the last few years, but recruitment is probably the No 1 thing they've got wrong.' Keane did add a slight concern about the potential new appointment: 'You're talking about Dan Ashworth coming into Manchester United and being the best for the job, but he doesn't seem to hang around for long. 'He was at Brighton for a few years, and he's only been at Newcastle for a couple of seasons, so you have to look at that too. 'There's no doubt he's brilliant at his job, but who is to say he won't leave in 18 months for Real Madrid or Barcelona.' Ashworth worked as the FA's director of elite development between 2012 and 2018, creating the 'England DNA' that opened up a pathway from the youth teams to the senior side. He took up the position of technical director at Brighton in Spring 2019, leaving three years later to become Newcastle's sporting director.    As Mail Sport reported this week, Ashworth has found his remit limited at Newcastle and would be handed greater autonomy at Old Trafford. Ratcliffe, who paid Â£1.3billion for a 25 per cent stake in United and control of football operations, and his aide Sir Dave Brailsford, want to re-introduce a 'British soul' into United's operation. Ashworth's expertise is regarded as a key component of achieving this aim.",Ashworth's expertise is regarded as a key component of achieving this aim.
662,Solskjaer gives lowdown on Man City in his new role as UEFA Technical Observer,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Solskjaer-gives-lowdown-on-Man-City-in-his-new-role-as-UEFA-Technical-Observer/3302187,1 day ago,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has given his expert insight into the ways in which Manchester City overcame Copenhagen in his new role as UEFA Technical Observer.  The former Manchester United boss has been away from coaching since his sacking by the Old Trafford club in November 2021, though he has now returned to football in some capacity. The 50-year-old revealed in September that he had taken up a role with Europe's top governing body that sees him attend Champions League fixtures and provide reports throughout this season. 'I can watch teams from a different perspective than being a manager,' the six-time Premier League winner told The Athletic last year. 'Analyse them, solve problems, see how both teams will try to hurt each other.' Of all the out-of-work managers in the world, there might not be any better placed to breakdown the approach of Guardiola's side, given that Solskjaer's record against the Spaniard stands at a healthy four wins, four defeats and one draw.   The Norwegian highlighted three key facets of City's play in their 3-1 Champions League win against Copenhagen, which could make them near impossible for any team to stop. First was their answer to the Danish side's zonal pressing system that seeks to reduce the time afforded to City players on the ball while keeping their defensive rigidity. 'Guardiola's men used the full width of the pitch and played around Copenhagen's shape when they reverted to a 4-3-3.' He wrote in his analysis on UEFA's website. 'And they produced the killer balls, usually to Kevin De Bruyne or Bernardo Silva, who, with perfect timing, were able to run into spaces between the full-back and the centre-half.' It was the Belgian who opened the scoring for the defending champions after latching onto an incisive pass from Foden on the right flank. Jacob Neestrup's team changed their shape in the second period to enable their wing-backs to be more aggressive. And it worked for large stretches, though City's quality still ultimately told. That fact was particularly evident in Solskjaer's second observation which concerned City players' ability to evade pressure. This is a common feature of Guardiola's side, as the former Barcelona manager's system and player selection enables his team to play out of danger after initially inviting it to lure opponents out of their defensive shape.   'City's players are so good at receiving the ball on the back foot,' Solskjaer continued. 'Even moving backwards in tight spaces with players around them, so aware are they of the positions of others.' Solskjaer was also keen to highlight the Manchester side's constant positional rotation that made it extremely difficult for Copenhagen's defence to stay with Guardiola's men. 'It was not easy for the home midfielders with Bernardo Silva and De Bruyne managing to get into the spaces on the other side and City stretching the hosts' defensive line.' The former Cardiff boss added. 'That's where the visitors hurt them most.'",'It was not easy for the home midfielders with Bernardo Silva and De Bruyne managing to get into the spaces on the other side and City stretching the hosts' defensive line.'

The Gunners swept aside the Irons at the London Stadium with goals from William Saliba, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel, Leandro Trossard and Declan Rice. As Bukayo Saka noted, it was a 'statement' victory as Mikel Arteta's team ensured they firmly remain in the title race. This week offers Arsenal a full period of preparation but the intensity of their schedule soon increases as their Champions League campaign returns. First up, a tricky trip to Turf Moor to take on Burnley awaits and then a European clash against Porto. Mirror Football will follow that journey and have rounded up the latest Arsenal news below. Declan Rice has labelled Ethan Nwaneri a 'special, special talent' after the 16-year-old featured in Arsenal's win over West Ham. The youngster drew the praise of his teammates after his cameo against the Hammers as the likes of Ben White, Saliba and Saka all showed their support after the teenager posted to Instagram. Nwaneri last appeared in a Premier League match in September 2022, and is highly regarded by the north London side. So much so it turns out, that Arsenal's substitutes were calling for his introduction. âThere is something that you have to [have] in your team, and that is the trust of the teammates,"" said Arteta following the game. ""And I had two things: one, the players on the bench whispering to bring Ethan on, which is a great thing to hear, and the other one your teammates want to give you the ball all of the time. ""If they do that, itâs because they really trust you and you can only have to see how many times he was involved in that. So it was a great sign."" Arsenal and Chelsea are among the clubs assessing whether they should make a move for Athletic Bilbao star Nico Williams. Both sides have scouted the 21-year-old this season. According to Caught Offside, the race is still open for the Spain international, despite Williams being on Chelsea's list of targets last summer. Neither club has progressed far in making a move. The winger has already recorded five goals and 10 assists so far this term for the Basque club, where he plays alongside his brother, Ghana international, Inaki. Once again Douglas Luiz is being mentioned in relation to a possible move to the Emirates. The Gunners have long tracked the Villa midfielder but are said to be competing with both Bayern Munich and Manchester City for his signature should the Brazilian decide to depart the Midlands. However, after an impressive start to the season has seen Villa challenging for the Champions League, their faltering form may bring some concern. Unai Emery's side have dropped out of the top four and now sit fith in the table. Reports suggest that missing out on Europe's premier competition will see Aston Villa have a more difficult time in persuading Luiz to remain with the club. The 25-year-old's contract is set to expire in 2026.",Reports suggest that missing out on Europe's premier competition will see Aston Villa have a more difficult time in persuading Luiz to remain with the club.

Paris Saint-Germain star Mbappe has been heavily linked with a move to Real, who could give the Frenchman a signing bonus of Â£85million and a 60/40 split of image rights. Ancelotti was asked about Mbappe in his post-match press conference following Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Girona. However, Ancelotti claimed that he can already call upon the best player in the world in Vinicius Jr, closely followed by Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, Toni Kroos, Federico Valverde and Eduardo Camavinga. Ancelotti said: 'You keep asking me about a player who plays for another team'.  'We already have the best players in the world here'. 'In order: Vini Jr first, Bellingham second, Rodrygo third. Then Kroos, Valverde, Camavingaâ¦'. Mbappe has scored 242 goals in 289 games for PSG but there have been suggestions that he wants a fresh challenge at Real. As Ancelotti alludes to, Real can already call upon an array of stars, including Vinicius Jr, who has scored seven goals and provided four assists in 15 LaLiga appearances so far this season. Real are five points clear of Girona at the top of LaLiga and will be confident of winning the title. Mbappe has frequently been linked with Real in recent years but PSG are eager to keep him and will reportedly offer the forward a new two-year contract. ",

I had torn my thigh muscle in the quarterfinals, but with painkillers, I could run without feeling anything. I told our trainers these exact words: âIf I break, then let me keep breaking. I don't care. I just want to be able to play.â So I was putting ice on my leg when our team doctor, Daniel MartÃ­nez, came into the room holding this envelope, and he said, âLook, Ãngel, this paper came from Real Madrid.â I said, âWhat are you talking about?â He said, âWell, they're saying you're not in any condition to play. So they are forcing us to not let you play today.â I immediately knew what was happening. Everybody had heard the rumors that Real wanted to sign James RodrÃ­guez after the World Cup, and I knew that they were going to sell me to make room for him. So they didn't want their asset to be damaged. It was that simple. That's the business of football that people do not always see. I told Daniel to give me the letter. I didn't even open it. I just ripped it into pieces and said, âThrow it away. The one who decides here is me.â I had not slept much the night before. Part of the reason was that the Brazilian fans were setting off huge fireworks outside of our hotel all night long, but even if it had been completely quiet, I don't think I would've been able to sleep. It is impossible to explain the feeling you have on the night before a World Cup Final, when everything you ever dreamed about is right in front of your eyes. I sincerely wanted to play that day even if it ended my career. But I also didn't want to make things complicated for our team. So I woke up early that morning and went to see our manager, Mr. Sabella. We had a very close relationship, so if I told him that I wanted to start, I knew that he would feel the pressure to put me in. I told him sincerely, with my hand on my heart, that he should put in the player that he felt he had to put in. I said, âIf it's me, it's me. If it's another, then it's another. I just want to win the World Cup. If you call on me, I will play until I break.â And then I started crying. I couldn't help it. The moment had overwhelmed me.  When we had our team talk before the match, Sabella announced that Enzo PÃ©rez was going to start, because he was 100% healthy. I was at peace with that decision. I treated myself with an injection before the match, and again during the second half, so that I would be ready to play if I was called from the bench. But the call never came. We lost the World Cup, and I couldn't control anything. It was the most difficult day of my life. After the match, the media were saying ugly things about why I didn't play. But what I'm telling you is the absolute truth. What still haunts me is the moment when I went to speak to Sabella, and I broke down in tears in front of him. Because I will always wonder if he thought that I was crying because I was nervous. In truth, it had nothing to do with nerves. I was overcome with emotion because of how much the moment meant to me. We were so close to achieving the impossible dream. ",
666,"Jack Grealish's devastation was clear to see when he was injured, Ladyman says",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Jack-Grealishs-devastation-was-clear-to-see-when-he-was-injured-Ladyman-says/3302176,1 day ago,"Ian Ladyman has expressed his sympathies for Jack Grealish on It's All Kicking Off, stating he was 'desperately sorry' for the Man City star who looked devastated after he suffered an injury during his side's 3-1 win against FC Copenhagen on Tuesday night.  The England forward appeared to suffer a muscle injury during the first half of the game, dropping to the floor and wincing in pain as he challenged for the ball with Copenhagen's Diogo Goncalves. Pep Guardiola stated that Grealish may have suffered a groin problem and while the 28-year-old managed to come back onto the field for several moments after receiving treatment, he was ultimately replaced by Jeremy Doku. It was a rare start for the England forward, who has struggled for game time recently following the arrival of Doku. Grealish, in fact, had not started in a match for City since their 5-0 victory against Huddersfield in the FA Cup on January 7. Speaking on It's All Kicking Off, Ladyman, who was joined by Chris Sutton, also claimed that Grealish will be thinking about his place in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the upcoming Euros.   'Now, one player who has adapted since he's been at City is Jack Grealish,' Ladyman said. 'I'm a fan of Jack, you're a fan of Jack. Great season last year with City as they won the treble, pretty much finished the season as one of their main men. Hasn't gone for him this season, been out of the team. 'He got a start against Copenhagen on Tuesday night and came off with an injury after about 20 minutes. And I have to say, he went down under a challenge, but it was apparent straight away that it was a muscle injury. 'You could actually see the devastation on Grealish's face before he'd even hit the deck because he knew that he'd pulled something. And I felt desperately sorry for the lad. He is one player at that club who's having no luck this season.' Grealish has returned three goals and two assists across 26 matches for City so far this season, but has struggled to break into Guardiola's starting XI, starting in only seven Premier League games. Ladyman continued: 'I begin to wonder how he's going to cope between now and the end of the season, because what will also be in his mind is his England place ahead of the European championships.' Despite that, Sutton believes his spot in Southgate's England team was not under threat, saying: 'Do you think his England place is in jeopardy? I don't see it that way.' Ladyman responded: 'There are other candidates, James Maddison, Cole Palmer, you know.' But Sutton interjected, and while Southgate may have been criticised for his loyalty to certain players in the past, the ex-England player stated that it is likely the Three Lions boss will stand by his principles and pick Grealish. 'We know Gareth [Southgate] is loyal. We know Gareth is a stickler for loyalty,' he stated. While it's unclear how long Grealish will be out for at this stage, Sutton reflected on what it's like to go through injury rehabilitation while the rest of your team-mates are out on the training pitch.     'I had a few times in my career where I had longer spells out where you're trying to recover from an injury and you always feel you're playing catch up in that respect. Have you heard of the hedonic treadmill? 'You sort of want it to be eat, sleep, work, repeat. You want to get into a rhythm where it's the same process every day. And, of course, when you have injuries, it becomes a problem - you stop. 'You're always striving to get back to that highest possible level of fitness. And you're trying to get back into the team as quickly as possible. 'But when you keep then lapsing as Grealish has this season, it becomes a problem. It's very individual, but I always found it affected my confidence. Fitness was the biggest or the most important thing to my game. 'You can turn around and say, ""well, you weren't the quickest player, you weren't the strongest player"". I would accept all that, but when I was 100 per cent fit I had total confidence in my game. 'I knew that I would have bad moments and bad games, but in general, mentally, I felt really strong. And I think when I had injury issues, there's always that little bit of doubt mentally, that little bit of uncertainty. Will your hamstring go again or whatever injury you're coming back from? 'There's always that danger of that. That seems to be where Jack is at this moment in time. There's no real flow. There's no rhythm. 'It's difficult for him at Manchester City because they are the best team in the land, they're the best team in the world. And also he's got Jeremy Doku, hasn't he? He [Doku] is a direct rival and he's not helping Jack Grealish, whether you like it or not, because he's probably the No 1 there on that left-hand side for Manchester City at this moment in time.   'He is going to have to sit and wait and recover and be ready when he does get the opportunity. I know they are different players, but Jack will be desperate to get back as quickly as possible, from any injury which he has, but then you need time to bed yourself in and to get to the level again. And that's been his issue this season really.' He added: 'Jack hasn't quite got going this season just yet. The problem he has at Manchester City is they are the best team. 'And there's always going to be great competition for places. And at this moment on that left hand side, I think he's in second place.'","'And there's always going to be great competition for places. And at this moment on that left hand side, I think he's in second place.'"
667,Erik ten Hag says playing with Casemiro will aid Kobbie Mainooâs development,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Erik-ten-Hag-says-playing-with-Casemiro-will-aid-Kobbie-Mainoo%E2%80%99s-development/3299190,11 Feb,"Erik Ten Hag believes playing with Casemiro will help Kobbie Mainoo reach his potential more quickly. Eighteen-year-old Mainoo has been the brightest part of a difficult season so far for Manchester United, with the midfielder establishing himself as an important member of the side. The teenager was given his chance following the hamstring injury suffered by Casemiro at the beginning of November. But the Brazil international, who is 13 years Mainooâs senior, is now fit again and they have played together in the last three games, all of which United have won. Boss Ten Hag said: âWe missed over a long period very important players like Casemiro, (Lisandro) Martinez, Luke Shaw, also others. We discussed that often. But you see the impact from a player when he is there, like Casemiro. âHe gives you calmness and composure on the ball. He gives you options, he does see the vertical pass. âHe is always a step ahead of his opponent and can break lines. Casemiro is a very important player for our game. We are happy he is back. âFor Kobbie Mainoo, he can learn a lot from it. That togetherness, that bond, also Kobbie is very coachable and Casemiro has so much experience. Erik ten Hag pats Kobbie Mainoo on the head  âKobbie will learn a lot from it, and that can even accelerate his development. We are happy to have him and, when they play together, they can benefit from each other. âCasa takes that responsibility. He has taken to him and he is talking to him. âI see it in the dressing room and on the pitch, also in training and in games. He is looking at his own game, but he is trying to help and support Kobbie Mainoo.â Green shoots have emerged among a troubled time at Old Trafford in the form of Mainoo and his fellow young guns Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho. All have been to the fore in Unitedâs improved form, which sees them head into Sundayâs clash with Aston Villa chasing a fourth successive win. Ten Hag is mindful, though, of not overplaying his rising stars, saying: âI brought them out on Sunday because it was the second game in nearly three days. âI brought them out against Nottingham Forest, the third game in a week, and I have to protect the player. âThey have to get used to the Premier Leagueâs intensity. You can only train this in the Premier League or Champions League where you have to perform every third day. âThen you have to make considerations about the team and result, but also about protecting players so they donât get injured. âKobbie was twice injured and we donât want to come into that situation again because it halts his progress.â",âKobbie was twice injured and we donât want to come into that situation again because it halts his progress.â
668,"Maguire praises 'exceptional' Hojlund, saying Man Utd knew he'd excel in scoring",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Maguire-praises-exceptional-Hojlund-saying-Man-Utd-knew-hed-excel-in-scoring/3301797,2 days ago,"Harry Maguire has suggested that he and his Manchester United 'always knew' that Rasmus Hojlund would find form after his Â£72million move from Atalanta to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window in a new interview.  The Denmark international struggled in front of goal during the first-half of the side's campaign and was forced to wait until December to score his first in the Premier League against Aston Villa. But since breaking his duck in the English top flight, the 21-year-old has been enjoying a relatively purple patch, scoring five goals in his last five Premier League outings. Hojlund has scored 11 in total across all competitions and Erik ten Hag will hope that the former Serie A starlet can be the sharp prong of their attack as the club prepares to claw its way back into the European places in the second-half of the season. For former club captain Maguire, there has been no surprise that Hojlund has rediscovered his shooting boots, with the England international stressing that in training, his team-mate has always looked 'an exceptional talent'.   'We've seen the talent he has and now it is really clicking for him in front of goal,' Maguire told Sky Sports. 'We always knew that was going to come because he's an exceptional talent. 'He's going to be a big player for this club. I'm sure he'll keep scoring goals and there are many more to come. 'As senior players you see a young player coming through - and he holds himself so well and so mature people don't realise his age - but he's come in with a big weight on his shoulders to be the main striker for Man United. 'He's had to play every game because of injuries but you see in training the work he puts in, the talent he has, the physical capability to play in this league, we knew he'd be successful for this club.' Hojlund's firmer footing has been part of a wave of youth talent helping Ten Hag's team to wrestle an uneven season back under their control, with academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo and Argentina international Alejandro Garnacho considered to be two of the brightest sparks in the squad. 'It's really encouraging, the young boys coming through at this club,' the defender added. 'This club has built a philosophy where young players get chances and if you take your chance you stay in the team and this manager has proved that.  'Since he's come in, the young players train with us a lot and when they train well and impress they stay and get more opportunities to impress. 'It doesn't matter how young you are, if you're playing well you keep your place.' Despite being one of the side's elder statesmen, Maguire can attest that his manager is keen to reward good performances. The 30-year-old was considered to be on the fringes of the squad at the start of the season, but amid a number of defensive injuries, Maguire stepped up and re-established himself as a regular starter in Ten Hag's first-choice XI before his run was stymied by injury in December. Since returning fit to face West Ham and see out a 3-0 home victory at the start of the month, Maguire has also proved that he is capable of playing on the left side of a central defence partnership - which has been previously disputed by Ten Hag. 'The manager has always reiterated about his philosophies of having a left footer playing left centre-back and a left footer at left-back as well, obviously Victor (Lindelof) had to come in at half-time and play that role (when Luke Shaw was injured vs Villa),' Maguire continued. Stating that he was 'comfotable' playing on the left, Maguire said that he had confidence in playing alongside Raphael Varane in the position.  'We haven't had a settled back four for a while,' Maguire said, underscoring Man United's patchy injury record. 'It's been difficult. 'The injury set me back a little bit and it was frustrating to be out for eight weeks but it's nice to pick up the rhythm again.' There has been no let up for the club with Lisandro Martinez's return from a long-term injury cut agonisingly short after the Argentina star damaged his medial ligament in his right knee against West Ham. Martinez is set to be sidelined for at least another eight weeks, taking in ties including upcoming Premier League fixtures against Luton Town, Fulham and Manchester City, and an FA Cup fifth round clash against Nottingham Forest at the end of the month.","Martinez is set to be sidelined for at least another eight weeks, taking in ties including upcoming Premier League fixtures against Luton Town, Fulham and Manchester City, and an FA Cup fifth round clash against Nottingham Forest at the end of the month."

If Tony Gustavsson's side beat Uzbekistan later this month in a two-legged play-off for a spot at this year's Olympics, the match against the Latin Americans in the US will be crucial ahead of the Games in Paris come July 26. Gustavsson said he was excited to face the world No.35 team. 'When I started with the Matildas we identified the need to continue challenging ourselves against different types of styles, opponents and experiencing high quality matches that allows us to strive to get one day better,' he said. 'Every match we schedule is deliberate and are key to our bigger picture of preparing the team for global tournaments and to take on the best teams in the world.   'With quality players across the park, where many play their club football with top teams, Mexico is certainly an opponent that will offer strong competition, and the knowledge we will gain from the questions they ask will boost our team.' Australia and Mexico have played on nine previous occasions, with the Matildas having won eight and lost just once since their first meeting back in 2003. Meanwhile, Matildas trio Caitlin Foord, Kyra Cooney-Cross and Steph Catley are out of the Women's FA Cup after Arsenal slumped to a 1-0 fifth-round loss to Manchester City on Monday. The Gunners were repeatedly denied by 19-year-old City goalkeeper Khiara Keating, who made a number of stunning late saves. Arsenal were also incensed when they believed the City shot-stopper had not saved a last-ditch effort from a scramble before it crossed the line - but the game day officials disagreed. Mary Fowler came off the bench for the Citizens, replacing injured striker Bunny Shaw in the 67th minute. Alanna Kennedy was brought on in injury-time to close out the game as her team sealed progression to the quarter-finals. Elsewhere, Matildas midfielder Clare Wheeler played 60 minutes as Everton thrashed Nottingham Forest 7-1 and defender Charli Grant played a full game as Tottenham beat Charlton 1-0.","Elsewhere, Matildas midfielder Clare Wheeler played 60 minutes as Everton thrashed Nottingham Forest 7-1 and defender Charli Grant played a full game as Tottenham beat Charlton 1-0."

United players were annoyed by the manner in which Douglas Luiz celebrated in front of goalkeeper Andre Onana after making it 1-1. And Varane did not forget about the Brazilianâs antics while the rest of the United side celebrated in front of their fans when McTominay pounced in the 86th minute. Erik ten Hag was quizzed on Douglas Luiz's celebration in his post-match press conference and admitted it may have motivated his players to win the match. He said: ""I donât have an opinion on it. ""I havenât spoken to the players. It may have fuelled the players. I donât know. We have to think about our game. Not about the opposition. We always want to control the game and dictate it. That should be our approach."" Douglas Luiz was also involved in an altercation with Rasmus Hojlund as the Denmark international left the pitch in the final couple of minutes. The United striker, who scored the opening goal as he continued his impressive run, was in no rush to leave the pitch after being substituted and that incensed Douglas Luiz, who went over to grab his opponent and usher him off. The win was United's third on the bounce in the  Premier League  as they look to secure a return to the Champions League. They remain sixth in the table but there will potentially be five Champions League spots available next season. But instead of potentially being 11 points behind fifth-place Villa, whose form has faltered in the past month, they are now only six. ""It was massive,"" Ten Hag said on the importance yesterdayâs result. ""It's a massive win for us. So, we get closer. And that was the aim for today and was absolutely our target. ""We did it. And I think also the way we did it, I think I liked it, and of course, I liked especially the first 20 minutes. And when we are dictating the game, after I think we are dropping a little bit too much. We had our moments in the counter attacks, but yeah, I think then at 1-1, to fight back, we are really happy.""","""We did it.

However the outlet that has revealed many of the more recent twists in the legal case suggest that the simultaneous investigation regarding misappropriation of funds could be more fruitful for the prosecutor.  Thus far, no evidence has been found of Barcelona making payments to referees directly, or Negreira himself doing so in exchange for favourable treatment. Equally, it remains to be seen whether Negreira could be considered a public official, and therefore whether the bribery charge would apply. El Mundo recently revealed that the Court Magistrate directing the investigation Joaquin Aguirre has asked the police to investigate the mid-level management at Barcelona in order to establish how they operated, including requesting internal club communications. Now the same paper are saying that in private Negreira has remarked that the money he was paid, subsequently withdrew in cash, and seemingly has not been spent by Negreira, returned to the offices at Barcelona. This does not rule out the above being strategy as part of an effort to pay for refereeing favours, but certainly would suggest that the money was not necessarily aimed at those refereeing the matches themselves.","This does not rule out the above being strategy as part of an effort to pay for refereeing favours, but certainly would suggest that the money was not necessarily aimed at those refereeing the matches themselves."

Sin bins have been deemed a success in the grassroots game and details of a trial to test them at higher levels of football for dissent as well as tactical fouls were set to be published by the International Football Association Board, which sets footballâs laws, last Friday. Publication was indefinitely delayed at the last minute however, with sources citing the need for further discussion to take place at next monthâs IFAB annual general meeting. The delay followed reports last Thursday evening which highlighted that blue cards would be used to send players to the sin bin. Ange Postecoglou was critical of the idea of sin bins in professional football  The idea of trialling sin bins was heavily criticised by Tottenham and Liverpool bosses Ange Postecoglou and Jurgen Klopp among others last week. However, Martin Cassidy, the chief executive of the Ref Support charity, believes the IFAB deserves credit for trying to address the problem, and hit out at the Professional Footballersâ Association (PFA) and the League Managersâ Association (LMA) for failing to condemn bad behaviour from their members. âI think the sin bin is the answer. Absolutely. Thereâs a proven track record,â he told the PA news agency, pointing out that Football Association trials at grassroots level in 2017-18 and 2018-19 saw a 38 per cent reduction in dissent. âYou canât throw stones at the IFAB and the FA for bringing in measures to address poor behaviour in the game,â Cassidy added. âThe main people they are trying to control are the players and the managers, when the PFA and the LMA only seem to want to talk about what makes the experience better for their members, and not the match official. âThe hypocrisy by those two organisations is breathtaking, when they put their name to that charter (Love Football, Protect The Game) at the start of the season. âWhat have they done publicly to condemn the behaviour of their members over the years? The answer is zero. Theyâre sitting on the sidelines, metaphorically and physically, doing absolutely nothing.â The PFA and the LMA have been approached for comment. Cassidy also said that blue cards were âthe best way to communicateâ that a player had been temporarily dismissed at higher levels of football, with yellow cards used at grassroots level. Protocols for trials allowing referees to create captain-only zones and cooling-off areas in the event of mass confrontations were also set to be published on Friday. Cassidy also welcomed those measures, adding: âIâm all for it. When Aleksandar Mitrovic pushed Chris Kavanagh, I said we should have a two-metre zone around an official. Aleksandar Mitrovic was sent off after he pushed referee Chris Kavanagh in an FA Cup tie last season  âThere is no reason to go within two metres of a match official other than to shake their hand at the beginning and the end of the game. We should create boundaries with officials. âThis problem has been going on for decades and never been addressed. Just have an agreement where you donât go within a certain place, and letâs say two metres. âWeâre used to two metres with Covid â why would you not want that in football? Then everybody knows anyone who comes in will be sanctioned.â",âWeâre used to two metres with Covid â why would you not want that in football?

It leaves them with an uphill task for the second leg at home in the Round of 16.  For PSGâs first goal, Mbappe was left unmarked by Takefusa Kubo at the back post to volley in at a tight angle. However Hamari Traore was the player assigned to Mbappe, but the Senegalese international was off the pitch after he received treatment from the previous play. âI canât understand how a player who has had to leave the pitch when the team was conceding a goal doesnât end up in the hospital. I donât understand it. If a player leaves the team with one man less, itâs because he has to go to the hospital. It is something that I am very clear about,â Alguacil told Cadena Cope. âThat player left the game and at the same time as he went, the team also went.

We canât allow these errors in the Champions League,â he fumed. Alguacil was not willing to give up on the tie as a whole though. âDespite everything, Iâm leaving happy. I think that if we play the first half we did here today, we will have our chances of standing up, competing and putting PSG in difficulties.â âThank you to everyone who has come here and I say to them that it is true that it is a 2-0, and that it is not going to be easy, but that we are going to try and that with everyoneâs support, if we are able to play like in the first halfâ¦ Why not dream?â After the game, Kubo admitted that it was âhis errorâ that led to the opening goal, but just as worrying for La Real is their lack of cutting edge up top. Mikel Oyarzabal is likely to be back for the second leg, but neither of Umar Sadiq nor Andre Silva have looked like scoring regularly this season. It is now five matches since the Txuri-Urdin found the back of the net, and it is threatening their place in Europe next season.","After the game, Kubo admitted that it was âhis errorâ that led to the opening goal, but just as worrying for La Real is their lack of cutting edge up top.

676,Haller made incredible comeback by scoring Ivory Coast winner for AFCON victory,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Haller-made-incredible-comeback-by-scoring-Ivory-Coast-winner-for-AFCON-victory/3300919,13 Feb,"In the world of professional football, where the spotlight shines brightest on the pitch, the news of a player being diagnosed with cancer sends shockwaves through the entire sporting community.  Yet, amidst the darkness of such news, there are stories that provide hope and inspiration. From Jonas Gutierrez's courageous battle with testicular cancer to Stiliyan Petrov's inspiring comeback from acute leukemia, each story is a testament to those athletes. Inspired by the recent journey of Sebastian Haller, who bravely battled cancer, reclaimed his place on the pitch and scored the winner for Ivory Coast at AFCON, this feature shines a spotlight on footballers who have faced similar challenges. From the depths of diagnosis to the heights of recovery and return, Mail Sport have rounded up the individual that exemplify courage, perseverance, and the unwavering determination to defy the odds.  Bournemouth winger David Brooks was diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare form of blood cancer that affects the white blood cells, in October 2021. But after undergoing 18 months of treatment for the disease, Brooks was given the all clear in May 2022. He said: 'It has been a few months since my last update and in that time I have thankfully completed my cancer treatment. I would like to say a huge thank you to all of the incredible medical staff for their amazing work and support throughout the process. 'Last week I met with my specialist having reviewed my final test results. I am delighted to say the treatment was successful and I can now say that I have been given the all clear and am now cancer free. 'Those words feel incredible to say and I am so thankful for all your messages and good wishes, these really helped me through the tough times.' Brooks was named in Gary O'Neil's starting XI for the first time in 598 days when Bournemouth faced Manchester United in May 2023. He had made four appearances off the bench since March but said he was beyond excited to start a game.  Jonas Gutierrez was diagnosed with cancer in October 2013 and underwent surgery in December. The midfielder was given the all-clear after a year and returned to action to help Newcastle avoid relegation. However, Gutierrez was frustrated with how his cancer diagnosis was handled.  He claimed he was forced to pay for his treatment and said he was told by the former Newcastle manager, Alan Pardew, that he would no longer feature in 'Newcastle's plans'. Gutierrez, who had been at the forefront of the Newcastle squad, said he was shocked at the 'sudden change of heart' and that the situation caused him a lot of 'distress'. He said: 'I believe that the reason for this was due to my cancer diagnosis and very recent operation to remove the tumour, as I had clearly been a crucial part of Newcastle's first team lineup to this point. 'I think they feared that my illness would mean that I could no longer play at the highest level and they considered me to be a liability rather than an asset to the club. 'I got the impression that they thought I couldn't be the same player again after such an illness or that I would be bound to have lingering effects other episodes of illness off the back of it. This caused me a lot of distress given my hard work and commitment for the club in the preceding five and half years.' As a result, Gutierrez launched a Â£2million disability discrimination claim against the club, saying they dropped him from the team because of his battle with cancer.  Stiliyan Petrov was diagnosed with Leukemia in 2012. He spent five years building himself back up after undergoing 13 months of treatment. Speaking about his diagnosis, Petrov said: 'It came from nowhere. My football, my dreams, all of it taken away from me. Everything I had planned for, everything that I thought would happen, everything that I wanted to achieve disappeared in a single second. 'I had to put everything on the side. And what I had to do was battle for my life. My battle was to survive. A battle to still be a human being, still be a father, still be a husband, still be somebody who wants to achieve more after the football. But I could not.' Petrov did try to return to football and even looked for a new deal with Aston Villa. However, it never came off and he decided to hang up his boots despite being touted for a return in 2016.  Arjen Robben was just 20-years-old when he found a lump on the his left testicle. The Dutch winger underwent surgery to remove the unwanted lump and returned to football soon after. Speaking about his diagnosis after recovering from cancer, Robben said: 'I was very scared - it was a very difficult time. I found a little lump and went to the doctor. He told me I needed an operation. I then had to wait for the results and I didn't know if it was going to be good or bad news. 'The waiting was terrible for a few days. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. It was a horrible wait, then I heard the news was good and it was a massive relief. 'At that time football was no longer important - the most important thing is to be healthy and for your family to be healthy. Football is my life but my family's health is the most important thing in the world.'  Abidal's remarkable story began in March 2011. He was 31 and in his fourth season as a powerful defender for Pep Guardiola's Barcelona when he went to hospital for routine medical tests. Abidal told Mail Sport: 'I felt in good health. My fitness scores were high. I'd always looked after my body. When they told me I had a tumour in my liver, I got a huge shock. He went on to add: 'But this can happen to anyone, whatever your age, whatever your job. You can have all the money in the world but nothing prepares you for cancer.' Abidal had an operation and, incredibly, returned to the first-team fold within six weeks. Only 71 days had passed since the operation when 'Abi' played his first 90 minutes - in the 3-1 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final at Wembley. 'That game was an obsession for me. I was determined to get myself right. Pep was amazing, sending me messages saying, ""Keep going, we are all counting on you to be there"".'  Former Union Berlin defender Timo Baumgartl was diagnosed with cancer in May 2022 after a tumour was found during a routine check-up. When asked about his diagnosis, Baumgartl said: 'When you're given the cancer diagnosis you're forced to think about what it would be like if you're no longer around.' Thankfully, Baumgartl recovered from cancer after undergoing surgery and several rounds of chemotherapy. He also returned to football five months later - starting Union Berlin's clash with Wolfsburg (which they ended up winning 2-0 to put them top of the table). Baumgartl was overcome with emotion after the final whistle and said the following in his post-match interview: 'This is exactly what I dreamed about the whole time during my chemotherapy: to come back into the starting line-up and to win.'  Francesco Acerbi was diagnosed with testicular cancer in June 2013 and underwent treatment to get rid of the disease. However, he found out it had returned in December later that year. Acerbi continued to battle back against the disease and was given the all clear before going on to make his international debut for Italy in 2014. 'With everything I went through, I am happy and proud, but I have objectives and when I've reached them I will be satisfied. What are they? I won't tell,' Acerbi told Rai Sport after the match. 'If you want to reach your targets, then you need to work hard, sweat and have that hunger within you. If you don't have it in you, then it's impossible to get there.'  Borussia Monchengladbach defender Stefan Lainer was diagnosed with lymphoma in July 2023. The 31-year-old, who had made 125 appearances for the German club at the time, needed to stop playing and undergo treatment for the cancer. However, Lainer - who was ever-present in his first two seasons in Germany after completing a move from Austrian top-flight outfit Red Bull Salzburg in 2019 - did say the cancer had been detected 'extremely early' and that it was treatable with medication. Thankfully, Lainer made a full recovery and returned to training just over two months ago - with the Bundesliga giants releasing the following statement. 'Stefan Lainer is set to return to training for Borussia Monchengladbach. The right-back, who was diagnosed with lymphoma in July, has successfully completed the therapy that he had been undertaking over the past few months. A recent final examination showed that therapy had been successful for Lainer and that he had been cured of lymphoma.' While Lainer added: 'I'm thrilled that I can once again fully concentrate on football and train together with the team. The last weeks and months were a big challenge. I'm very thankful to have had so much support from my family, my friends, the club and the fans during this period. 'All this gave me strength. In particular, I would like to thank my wife and Dr. Sellmann, who were the most important sources of support during this time.'  Henri Lansbury was diagnosed with testicular cancer during his time at Nottingham Forest. Speaking on Sky Sports, Lansbury said: 'I was in the shower after training one day and was obviously having a feel as I was washing myself and I felt a lump. It was a little pea-sized lump. 'Over time I thought it would go away but a couple months passed and it was still there. We broke up for the summer, about to go on holiday... but it was eating me away for a few months. 'Obviously having it, not telling anyone and just trying to deal with it myself. And it came to the point where I thought I had to see someone and someone had to help me out. 'First of all, I just went down to the local hospital to see if I could get it checked out. But they said the lead time was a few weeks. Obviously, going on holiday, I didn't want to go away with it. 'So I had to phone the club and ask for help. They put me in contact with someone to go get it checked out. Had a scan there and he said 'alright we'll give you your results in a bit'. 'As I've left to get in my car, the doctor from Nottingham Forest has called me and said: 'Go and pack a bag. You're going back in for the operation tonight. It was a bit fast but glad to get it out'.  Linda Caicedo started feeling pain in her abdomen during the Covid-19 pandemic. After several tests, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. At just 15-years-old, Caicedo underwent surgery to remove a tumour and one of her ovaries. The surgery was successful and Caicedo returned to training with her club Deportivo Cali just days after her final round of chemotherapy. She went on to thrive at club level before being handed her international just three years after her diagnosis. The teenage star even scored on her debut to help Colombia secure a 2-0 win over South Korea in their Women's World Cup match in Sydney.  'At the time, I didn't think I could play professionally again because of all the treatments and surgeries I had to go through,' Caicedo told FIFA. 'Mentally, it was a very difficult moment in my life.' 'I'm forever grateful that it happened when I was very young. I was able to recover, I also had my family's support and I feel very good now. What happened made me grow. I feel thankful and happy to be here.'","'I'm forever grateful that it happened when I was very young. I was able to recover, I also had my family's support and I feel very good now. What happened made me grow. I feel thankful and happy to be here.'"
677,Mauricio Pochettino stresses need for patience with Chelseaâs young team,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mauricio-Pochettino-stresses-need-for-patience-with-Chelsea%E2%80%99s-young-team/3300689,12 Feb,"Chelsea head coach Mauricio Pochettino repeated his call for patience as his inexperienced squad look to find their feet in the Premier League. The Argentinian takes his side to Crystal Palace on Monday evening searching for a win which would lift the Blues into the top half of the table. Hopes that the players might finally be ready to live up to the expectation raised by having a Â£1billion first-team squad were ignited by last Wednesdayâs 3-1 victory at Aston Villa in their FA Cup fourth-round replay. But in the league there has been little cause for optimism, with the most recent outing â last weekendâs 4-2 home defeat to Wolves, which saw angry supporters turn on Pochettino and his team â representing the low point so far of a turbulent campaign. A win at Selhurst Park against Roy Hodgsonâs men would be just their 10th of the season in 24 league games. Pochettino said his team â on average the youngest in the top flight â will require more time than they have yet been given following the arrival of 12 new faces last summer. âIâm not picking the team because they are young,â he said. âI donât want to be the coach that picks the youngest team in England. Chelsea v Wolverhampton Wanderers â Premier League â Stamford Bridge  âWe are a young team. We have a good balance. We have Thiago Silva who is 39, we have Raheem Sterling (29), we have (Christopher) Nkunku (26), and (Axel) Disasi (25). The problem is not that they are young. The problem is that the team is young. âWe had (many) players that arrived new at the beginning of the season. You need to build a team. Always I talk about the team, itâs not about if you have 20 or 19-year-olds. We need to be consistent like a team. âAt the moment we have maybe not so good (balance), because we would be in another position.â The defeat to Wolves brought the first signs of Chelsea fansâ patience with the former Tottenham manager being tested. This time tomorrow, it's go time.  pic.twitter.com/d1ayKrJUCM â Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) February 11, 2024 There was audible discontent aimed at Pochettino directly, while players were also booed and supporters sang the name of former owner Roman Abramovich. The 51-year-old is not the only one under scrutiny, with Palace manager Hodgson also in the spotlight as his side sink down the table with just two wins in their last 12 games, but Pochettino has backed the 76-year-old to handle the pressure. âItâs part of the game, itâs football,â the Blues boss said. âHe has the experience to manage every situation. Itâll be good to see him, for sure weâre going to share a nice time together. âWe are not interested to talk about things that happen around us.â",âWe are not interested to talk about things that happen around us.â
678,The reason Reds & Villa are not in Europa or Conference League action this week,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/The-reason-Reds--Villa-are-not-in-Europa-or-Conference-League-action-this-week/3301698,2 days ago,"European knockout football got underway earlier this week as the Champions League round of 16 games kicked off, which saw Guardiola's Man City pull out a convincing performance to beat FC Copenhagen 3-1.  The Europa League and Europa Conference league is set to follow suit, with knockout games set for this Thursday and Friday however some eagle eyed fans may notice the top competitors in the two tournaments are nowhere to be seen. Liverpool, West Ham, Brighton and Aston Villa all qualified through their respective groups and earned themselves a spot in the knockout stage of their competitions, so why don't we see any of them in this week's round of European football.   Here's why... No English club will be playing in the Europa League or Conference League this week because of the competitions qualifying rules. The first knockout round of both tournaments is known as the knockout round play-off. This round is contested by 16 teams, the teams which make up this number are the eight teams who qualified second in their group during the group stages and the eight teams who have dropped into the competition after finishing third in their groups in the competition one level above it. So for the Europa League the eight teams will have dropped from the Champions League and in the Conference League the eight teams have dropped from the Europa League. Liverpool, West Ham, Brighton and Aston Villa don't fall into either of these categories meaning they don't have to participate in this stage of the competition. Instead all of the English clubs as well as Rangers get to bypass this round of the competition and progress straight into the round of 16 because they topped their group in the group stages. What teams are playing in the play-off round of knockout football?   The draw for the round of 16 in the Europa League will take place on Friday, February 23 and the draw for Conference League will be confirmed on February 22. The draw will consist of 16 teams, the eight group stage winners will be drawn against the winners of the knockout round play-offs. The first legs of the Europa League and Conference League round of 16 games are scheduled for March 7, with the second legs a week later on March 14. An all English round of 16 clash is impossible as no side can face another team from the same national association. The eight teams already seeded for the draw in both competitions are as follows.",The eight teams already seeded for the draw in both competitions are as follows.
679,"Merson's ""sad and frustrated"" admission after Arsenal's thumping of West Ham",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mersons-sad-and-frustrated-admission-after-Arsenals-thumping-of-West-Ham/3300810,12 Feb,"Paul Merson admitted he was left ""sad"" and ""frustrated"" after his former side Arsenal recorded their joint-largest ever away league win against West Ham.  Mikel Arteta's men ran out 6-0 winners at the London Stadium thanks to five different goalscorers. William Saliba sent them on their way, before Bukayo Saka scored his first from the penalty spot. Gabriel Magalhaes and Leandro Trossard's goals soon followed and it was 4-0 before the half-time whistle was blown. Saka secured his brace 10 minutes into the second-half, before Declan Rice netted a sensational strike against his former side to make it six. The victory also reduced the Hammers to their joint-heaviest ever home defeat, matching the 6-0 loss at the hands of Blackburn in December 1963. After the game, Merson conceded that despite the fact it was his old side who were at their brilliant best to record a historic victory, he harboured plenty of emotion over the dismal display West Ham put in. The pundit, who spent 12 years in north London, laid into David Moyes' men. ""Defending wise, if that happened at U10s football, youâd be going, âSeriously?â â not getting tight, showing them inside on their proper foot, it is poor,"" Merson told Sky Sports. ""Arsenal made West Ham surrender and I think thatâs quite sad. As a player, thatâs the one thing you donât want to do. ""There are ways of losing football matches but that was a horrible way. I felt sorry for David Moyes. That is not his team. They let him down today."" One incident that Merson really had a gripe with was the manner in which the Hammers conceded their fifth. Ben White's dummy run fools Emerson, who follows the right-back, leaving Saka isolated against Nayef Aguerd. The Arsenal No. 7 got the better of his man with one drop of the shoulder before lashing home. Analysing the incident, Merson bemoaned: ""Emerson, Ben White is not the danger! He lets him put a simple ball in. The (West Ham) centre-half, Saka is left-footed! You know heâs coming inside 99 out of 100 times. ""That tells me, as a player, do you really pay any attention to detail as to who you are playing against? Or are you just turning up? Youâve got to have more about you. It frustrates me. I donât even play and I know what Saka is going to do. It was poor all round.""","""That tells me, as a player, do you really pay any attention to detail as to who you are playing against?

Despite signing a new contract just over two months ago though, he continues to be linked with a move this summer.  Chelsea and Arsenal are the latest to be mentioned in conjunction with the 21-year-old, with plenty of rumours that Williams has a â¬50m release clause in his new deal, giving him control over his future. While there will likely be interest from elsewhere, Matteo Moretto has told The Daily Briefing that Williams is both happy in Bilbao, and grateful to Athletic for their investment in him. If a giant does come in for him, it will not be easy to convince him to leave Los Leones. Williamsâ continues to be a nightmare for defenders in La Liga, and with the premium continuing to rise on players that can beat their defender with the ball at their feet, if he continues on this trajectory, his path will very much be his to choose. Given the strong connection between Athletic players and the club, it would be no surprise to see him hold off an exit for another year or two.","Williamsâ continues to be a nightmare for defenders in La Liga, and with the premium continuing to rise on players that can beat their defender with the ball at their feet, if he continues on this trajectory, his path will very much be his to choose.

Palmer makes a first return to the Etihad Stadium since moving to west London in a surprise switch at the end of the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old cost Chelsea an initial Â£40million with an additional Â£2.5m in possible add-ons, but the deal has proved value for money as Palmer tops the Bluesâ scoring charts with 12 goals. Chelsea v Manchester City â Premier League â Stamford Bridge  âI have been surprised by how well itâs gone here so quickly, but I always back myself to succeed,â Palmer told the clubâs official website. âIâm looking forward to going back to the Etihad. It will be strange, a weird feeling, but Iâm looking forward to it and the teamâs looking forward to it. âIâm very excited to be honest, even though it will be strange. âObviously I played against them at Stamford Bridge, but I think going back to the Etihad will be even stranger.â Manchester City v Sevilla â UEFA Super Cup â Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium  The two teams produced a remarkable 4-4 draw at Stamford Bridge in November when Palmer equalised from the penalty spot in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Ten of Palmerâs Chelsea goals have come in the Premier League and his form has catapulted him into contention for a place in Englandâs Euro 2024 squad this summer. âWhen I made the decision to come down here with my family it was a really tough decision to leave,â said Palmer, who joined City at the age of eight and began the season by scoring for them in the Community Shield and Super Cup final. âBut I felt like I was ready to play week in, week out and showcase my ability. âSo thank you to the club and everyone who has supported me. âItâs down to the manager (Mauricio Pochettino) giving me the freedom, the club giving me the opportunity and the lads, who have been great with me since I came in. âIâve settled fast so Iâm enjoying it here.â Chelsea have had an inconsistent season under Pochettino and are currently 10th in the Premier League, 20 points behind leaders Liverpool and 18 adrift of City. Chelsea v Fulham â Premier League â Stamford Bridge  But successive 3-1 wins at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, the former coming in the FA Cup, have ensured that Chelsea take on Pep Guardiolaâs English, European and FIFA World Club champions with growing confidence. Palmer said: âThe manager helps us all every day. Little conversations telling us what to do. âWe have meetings and he believes in us and we believe in ourselves. âEveryoneâs going to talk when youâre not doing well, but we just need to try and block it out and focus on ourselves.â","âEveryoneâs going to talk when youâre not doing well, but we just need to try and block it out and focus on ourselves.â"

Grealish was forced off with a groin problem after 21 minutes of the holdersâ largely straightforward 3-1 victory over FC Copenhagen on Tuesday. Bernardo Silva also left the action before the end of the first leg of the last-16 tie after a blow to the ankle but it was Grealish pulling up that caused the most concern. WWWWWWWWW That's NINE #UCL wins in a row, the longest streak by any English side in the competition's history pic.twitter.com/gnnLridIer â Manchester City (@ManCity) February 13, 2024 âHe wanted to continue but we didnât want to make the damage even worse,â said manager Pep Guardiola after the game. âWeâll make tests tomorrow (Wednesday).â Grealish was making his first start in six games in what has been a difficult campaign for him. The 28-year-old had a spell out with a dead leg earlier in the season and has been kept out of the side at other times by the good form of team-mates, notably Jeremy Doku in the first instance and latterly Phil Foden. Another lay-off would be a blow for City as they chase a repeat treble, restricting attacking options soon after Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland had returned from their own injuries. Kevin De Bruyne scored one and made the other two for City  Silva could be doubtful for Saturdayâs Premier League clash with Chelsea while it has also emerged that Josko Gvardiol and Mateo Kovacic have been nursing knocks. Neither featured in Denmark and although midfielder Kovacic should be back in contention for the weekend, defender Gvardiol faces two to three weeks out with an ankle injury. Fitness issues aside, City were dominant at the Parken Stadium, controlling in all aspects as they eased to a win that was far more convincing than the scoreline suggested. The Danish champions, still in their winter break and clearly rusty, struggled to live with City and fell behind to an early De Bruyne strike. City spurned several chances to increase their advantage before an Ederson error gifted Copenhagen debutant Magnus Mattsson an unlikely equaliser.

The second leg takes place in three weeksâ time. âI think getting the early goal helped us,â said Foden. âIt is such a difficult place to come. âWeâre delighted with the performance and we take the 3-1 back. âI thought the way we controlled the game and we picked the right times to attack was brilliant. âI think we have a great group of lads. Weâre all determined and the hunger is just the same from last year, to keep on and keep pushing.â De Bruyne, who has quickly found top gear since returning from a five-month lay-off in January, provided the assists for both goals. âHeâs playing very well,â said defender Nathan Ake. âI think everyone expected him to come back a bit slower because heâs been out for five months or so, but straight away he hit the ground running and heâs been top.

684,Douglas Luiz responds to Ferdinand's taunt after Man Utd vs Aston Villa incident,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Douglas-Luiz-responds-to-Ferdinands-taunt-after-Man-Utd-vs-Aston-Villa-incident/3300792,12 Feb,"Aston Villa ace Douglas Luiz has responded to Rio Ferdinand after the Manchester United legend poked fun at the Brazilian's goal celebration over the weekend.  Villa took on the Red Devils on Sunday afternoon, with plenty on the line given both sides are vying for Champions League qualification. Scott McTominay eventually won the game for United with an 86th minute header, but it looked set to be a frustrating evening for Erik ten Hag's men when Rasmus Hojlund's opener was cancelled out by Luiz's second-half strike. The Brazilian fired Unai Emery's side level with a neat finish, before provocatively celebrating in the face of United defender Casemiro with a shimmy of the shoulders. Of course, Luiz was left with egg on his face when McTominay headed home United's winner. Ferdinand did not forget Luiz's celebration and after the full-time whistle was blown, took to social media to remind the Villa star. The ex-United centre-back uploaded an image of Luiz performing the celebration after scoring and tagged the midfielder. He wrote: ""You ok @dgoficial?"" alongside four laughing emojis. Luiz has since replied, with an explanation behind his post-goal antics. ""Iâm good, thanks itâs just carnival time in Brazil,"" he wrote. In the immediate aftermath of the celebration, Raphael Varane had to be stopped by referee Rob Jones from clashing with the Villa midfielder. Ten Hag addressed the clash after the game and discussed whether the celebration served as motivation for his United players. He told reporters: âI donât have an opinion on it. I havenât spoken to the players. It may have fuelised (fuelled) the players. I donât know. ""We have to think about our game. Not about the opposition. We always want to control the game and dictate it. That should be our approach."" Thanks to McTominay's late winner, United are now just five points behind Unai Emery's Villa side. Hopes are clearly high within the Red Devils camp that they can make a late charge for the top four, with Ten Hag issuing a confident rally cry. ""I think we can beat any opponent - away or at home,"" the Dutchman explained. ""We have to believe it more away from home. We could have won at Arsenal, at Liverpool - itâs about belief. This team believed it could win this game.""","""I think we can beat any opponent - away or at home,"" the Dutchman explained. ""We have to believe it more away from home.

686,Tuchel risks wrath of Bayern chiefs again by furiously slamming his own player,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tuchel-risks-wrath-of-Bayern-chiefs-again-by-furiously-slamming-his-own-player/3302169,1 day ago,"Thomas Tuchel once again risked the wrath of Bayern Munich chiefs as he openly criticised his side following defeat to Lazio.  The German coach singled out Dayot Upamecano after the French defender conceded a penalty that Ciro Immobile converted in the second period of the Champions League last 16 clash. Defeat in Rome saw Bayern record consecutive losses after Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen also earned a victory against Tuchel's men. It was the 10th defeat of Tuchel's tenure after 43 matches in charge of the Bundesliga giants. The 50-year-old reached the mark 41 games sooner than predecessor Julian Nagelsmann. ""Worried about my future? No I am not,"" Tuchel said following the game. However, he produced a damning assessment of Bayern's second half performance, placing the blame at their door rather than crediting Lazio. Tuchel said: ""We're frustrated and angry about the defeat. I think we lost the game, I'm not sure Lazio won it. ""We did everything we could to fall behind, making errors and losing confidence. (There was) no need for Upamecano to go in like that. It's not wild or intentional - but just block the shot. ""We started well, had a chance in the first minute and then with Harry Kane and then with Jamal Musiala. We had the game under control in the first half. ""But in the second our performance dropped inexplicably. We made too many individual errors and made our opponents stronger and we lost concentration. We lost our rhythm. ""It was completely our responsibility. We lost a game today that in the first half looked like we could not lose it."" It's not the first time Tuchel has publicly expressed his frustrations. Earlier in January, the former Chelsea boss said he 'didn't have the feeling that we were playing for victory' in defeat to Werder Bremen. He is also said to have irritated club chiefs early in the season for lamenting the depth of the squad. Bayern sit second in the Bundesliga and are now scrambling for success this term having won a trophy every year from 2012/13 onwards. Sporting director Christoph Freund admitted that Tuchel is struggling. He said: ""Of course Tuchel is struggling with the situation, which is very difficult for all of us. Our goal is to fight our way out of this together. Weâre all in the same boat, we are together""","He said: ""Of course Tuchel is struggling with the situation, which is very difficult for all of us.

687,EPL chief Masters under pressure from rebel clubs who united against leadership,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/EPL-chief-Masters-under-pressure-from-rebel-clubs-who-united-against-leadership/3298520,11 Feb,"Premier League chief executive Richard Masters is facing mounting criticism from a significant group of clubs who have united in opposition to his leadership over a number of issues.  Mail Sport can reveal that seven of the clubs who refused the back the Premier Leagueâs introduction of new associated party transaction rules [APT] this week were among the eight who voted down proposals to ban loan transfers last November, leading to concerns amongst the executive over the emergence of a group of serial rebels. Manchester City, Newcastle, Chelsea, Everton, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United are understood to have voted against the Premier League at a tense shareholdersâ meeting on Friday, with Crystal Palace and Burnley believed to have abstained. The motion to tighten APT rules was passed by the narrowest margin possible with two-third of the 18 votes cast in favour, but the row may rumble on as City are threatening to take legal action against the Premier League on the grounds that the restrictions breach competition law. The Premier League were left grateful to Wolves, who surprised many by voting in favour having previously opposed rules designed to prevent clubs from signing commercial deals with related companies at inflated prices.  Wolves were one of the eight clubs who blocked the introduction of a ban on loan deals between clubs who are part of the same ownership group last November, along with City, Newcastle, Chelsea, Everton, Forest, Sheffield United and Burnley. Wolves are understood to have altered their position due to the Premier League amending the APT regulations, although this change was not enough to mollify the other rebels. In another concerning development for the Premier League Crystal Palace appear to have joined the list of unhappy clubs by abstaining on Friday. Mastersâ position is not under immediate threat as he is busily engaged fighting for the Premier League on a number of fronts including their opposition to an independent regulator and negotiations with the EFL over the so-called New Deal for Football, but he is facing mounting complaints. In addition to this weekâs vote there is considerable unhappiness amongst the clubs over the Premier Leagueâs position on a number of key issues, including their enforcement of Profit and Sustainability Rules, proposed changes to the loan system and the financial settlement to be offered to the EFL as part of the New Deal. The Premier League clubs appear as divided as they have been in the competitionâs 32-year history, as there are also disagreements over their future TV rights and digital strategies. Just as significantly the divides are not neatly aligned along the traditional fault line of Big Six versus the rest, which is making life even harder for the Premier Leagueâs leadership.   Masters retains the support of the majority of clubs, but the rebels can still make life distinctly uncomfortable for him. A backlash from clubs over the Premier Leagueâs handling of Newcastleâs Saudi Arabian takeover led to the sudden resignation of chairman Gary Hoffmann three years ago. Masters is well-liked personally and there is a feeling among many clubs that his job has become almost impossible due to the range of powerful and competing vested interests currently running Premier League clubs. The 55-year-old has also had to contend with an unprecedented range of challenges during his four-year reign, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the European Super League, Newcastleâs Saudi takeover and the rise of multi-club ownership, as well as the ongoing battle with government over regulation.

688,Ancelotti angered by continued MbappÃ© questioning,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ancelotti-angered-by-continued-Mbapp%C3%A9-questioning/3299053,11 Feb,"In an interview after Real Madridâs victory against their La Liga title rivals Girona, Carlo Ancelotti was once again asked about the prospect of the Spanish club signing Kylian MbappÃ© (25) on a free transfer in the summer transfer window.  The former Everton manager was angered about the question regarding the France captain, due to the continued line of question. When asked about MbappÃ©, Ancelotti said, âYou keep asking me about a player who plays for another team. We have the best players in the world here. In order: Vini Junior first, Jude Bellingham second, Rodrygo third. Then Toni Kroos, Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga.â The transfer saga surrounding the Paris Saint-Germain forward continues to be the leading topic of conversation within the football world. Ancelotti appears to be annoyed by the extended speculation. According to Le Parisien, MbappÃ© has already decided on where his future will lie from the summer of 2024. The French publication reports that the France international attacker has decided to join Real Madrid when his contract at the Parc des Princes expires. However, with no official announcement from either the player or club, the speculation will continue to mount.","According to Le Parisien, MbappÃ© has already decided on where his future will lie from the summer of 2024.

689,Fulham 3-1 Bournemouth: Archer & co give Blades win over relegation rivals,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Fulham-3-1-Bournemouth-Archer--co-give-Blades-win-over-relegation-rivals/3297609,11 Feb,"Sheffield United had been accused of throwing in the towel in their battle for survival.  On this evidence, there is plenty of fight left in Chris Wilder's side yet. Wilder refused to call this relegation six-pointer a 'must-win', but defeat here would surely have ended their slim hopes of avoiding the drop. Instead, the Blades chose the perfect time to record their first league victory on the road as they ripped up the formbook and cut the gap to Luton to seven points. Game on. Two goals in six first-half minutes put them on course. Cameron Archer had produced one of the misses of the season but made immediate amends seconds later with what could turn out to be a vital strike in Sheffield United's campaign. Archer took advantage of a mistake from Gabriel Osho, nipped in and finished with aplomb.   The relief was there for all to see. Then VAR intervened. Referee Chris Kavanagh adjudged Reece Burke to have handled in the area when blocking a Vini Souza header and awarded a penalty, cooly converted by James McAtee. Early in the second half, Luton got a spot-kick of their own in similar circumstances, with Kavanagh giving handball against Souza after being told to go to the pitchside monitor. Carlton Morris did the rest to halve the deficit. Now it became a test of Sheffield United's mettle, and thankfully for Wilder and the 1,350 travelling fans, it was one they passed. As Luton went in search of an equaliser, the visitors countered. Ben Osborn fed Souza, whose right-footed drive found the bottom corner 18 minutes from time. Cue pandemonium in the away end. 'Come on Vini Souza, join us in the boozer,' they sang as they prepared to celebrate on the long trek home. Sheffield United will have had painful memories from when these two last met on Boxing Day as they contrived to steal defeat from the jaws of victory, so the visitors knew they still had work to do. And when the board went up showing nine added minutes, that job got slightly trickier against a Luton side who have been in free-scoring form of late. But the Hatters but were met by an impenetrable Sheffield United defence in the late stages. Sheffield United are, in Premier League terms, still along way from safety. Wilder will be hoping the grit and determination on display here is evident throughout the remainder of the campaign as they aim to defy the critics and doubters by keeping their place in the top flight.

690,Why Dan Ashworth is perfect to become Man United's sporting director,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Why-Dan-Ashworth-is-perfect-to-become-Man-Uniteds-sporting-director/3301709,2 days ago,"The first thing to know about Dan Ashworth is that his leadership style is not one of an iron fist.  'At none of the places I've been has it been ""Dan Ashworth's philosophy"",' he told the Training Ground Guru podcast in 2020. 'My principles are not autocratic. I don't believe in telling people, ""this is how we're going to be doing it,"" I believe in collaboration.' It is easy to see why Manchester United are smitten on the affable former PE teacher. Ashworth's track record speaks for itself: helping West Brom get into the Premier League, devising the 'England DNA' model, before laying the foundations for Brighton and Newcastle to crack European football. He's got his faults like any executive - the handling of the scandal involving Mark Sampson and Eni Aluko is a mark against his name - but Ashworth would be a perfect appointment as Manchester United's inaugural sporting director - and INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe know it. Ashworth, like many youngsters, harboured the football dream in his teenage years, doing his best to make the grade as a right back in Norwich City's academy. He was released at 17 and went on to spend a season in non-league, joining Eastbourne Town back in 1989. But Ashworth is smart enough to know when to change path and after dropping down to semi-pro football he combined work as a PE teacher at Darrick Wood School in Orpington with playing for St Leonards. After a stint Stateside coaching at West Florida Fury he returned to a teaching gig in England while playing for Wisbech Town. It was alongside his teaching that he honed his knowledge further, going on to complete the UEFA Pro Licence. Ashworthâs influence in football, ever since he was released by Norwich, was also sign-posted to come off the pitch in an administrative and strategic role. It was at Peterborough United where, by 2000, he had become academy director, rising up through the ranks in Cambridgeshire having started out as education and welfare officer.  No job was ever beneath him either. Wash the kit? No problem. Drive the minibus? Pass me the keys. It didnât go unnoticed from the higher ups at London Road. 'Even then, Dan made an impression,' Barry Fry, then Peterboroughâs first-team manager, said, as per the Athletic. 'The lads always found his sessions stimulating, different. It was never, ""Do it this way"". Heâd encourage them to problem-solve. He was always a very deep thinker, looking at ways to improve the whole club.' He would go on to spend three years as the centre of excellence head at Cambridge United before he got to cut his teeth in the big time - West Brom wanted him. Initially he was in an academy post, helping old friend Aidy Boothroyd, but by 2007 he was sporting and technical director overseeing four departments. Then manager Tony Mowbray hailed West Brom as a âvisionaryâ club for handing the role to Ashworth, who helped massively ease the load on coaching staff. Recruitment was a much bigger focus for him then than it is nowadays and insiders speak of âThe Shireâ, his video room at West Brom which was famed in the Black Country for its forensic analysis of potential players. Ashworth, a Lord of the Rings fan, hence the name, had cinema-style seats and a multi-screen set-up to chart players from across the world. It was DVD recorders he was relying on then, long before being a click away from every minute detail on services like WyScout that is so popular across top teams now.   âThe principle for a Technical Director, in my opinion, is to look after the medium to long term interests of the football club,â he told Training Ground Guru in 2020. âAnother thing thatâs important is the connection from the boardroom onto the pitch. âEvery club has a CEO and chairman - and budgets, philosophies and principles - and itâs really important we get that across, whether itâs club values or maximising the budget and making sure weâre spending the money in the right way.â And the long term goal at West Brom was to reach the Premier League and stay there; Ashworth delivered. From his time in the role between 2007 and 2012 the Baggies were promoted to the Premier League and went on to secure a top-half finish. Perhaps what is more pertinent - and interesting - relating to Ashworth and links to Manchester United is the foundations he laid for success at England, Brighton and most recently, Newcastle. Head-hunted by the FA to transform Englandâs fortunes - more widely throughout the game but with the end goal to deliver major tournament success - Ashworth oversaw the implementation of the âEngland DNAâ model. Instrumental in its deliverance, it consisted of five key elements: Take the playing style philosophy as one facet of the DNA model - it is something he would, in conjunction with Erik ten Hag, be expected to work on at United should he take on the job. âEngland teams aim to dominate possession intelligently, selecting the right moments to progress the play and penetrate the opposition,â the DNA bible reads. âOut of Possession: England teams aim to regain possession intelligently and as early and as efficiently as possible. All aspects of the out of possession philosophy will take into consideration the state of the game, the environment and the pre-determined game plan. âTransition: England teams aim to sense changing moments in the game both in and out of possession, reacting instinctively and intelligently. âFormation: England teams will play with tactical flexibility, based on the profile of the players available and the requirements of the match or competition.â It is inarguable that the manifesto, recited to more than 1,500 coaches by Ashworth and colleagues back in 2014, hasnât positively affected the national team. By 2018 they were in the World Cup semi-finals and at Euro 2020 they were beaten finalists at Wembley. At the Qatar World Cup in 2022, they were beaten by eventual runners-up France in the quarter-finals. Ashworthâs finger prints had been all over it and it was no surprise to see United sniffing around him in 2018, prior to his move to Brighton. Jose Mourinho was crying out for a sporting director to help him at Old Trafford. One never arrived and Mourinho paid with his job eventually. At Brighton, and most recently Newcastle, the job spec for Ashworth has been less about recruitment and the day-to-day and more the longer term planning to deliver the end goal: in Brightonâs case European football, something they achieved last season. At Newcastle it was to crack the top four, and they did that in his first year. 'Complacency is a dangerous thing, isn't it? Certainly thereâs no complacency here,' he told the Telegraph in November, then laughing off any prospect of swapping Newcastle for Manchester.    'We want to keep striving and keep pushing. Whether thatâs with our academy from under-nines. Whether thatâs the women's first-team. Whether thatâs improving the provision and psychology and player care around the team. 'Whether thatâs making improvements to the training ground, we've got to keep pushing. If you start to stand still in professional sport, youâre stuffed. It's about keep pushing, keep pushing, keep driving in all areas of the football club.' Manchester United need a visionary, a person INEOS can trust implicitly to work alongside incoming CEO Omar Berrada, first team boss Erik ten Hag, as well as key figures like Academy Director Nick Cox. A close friend of Sir Dave Brailsford, Ratcliffeâs right-hand man, there would be a familiarity to any switch to Old Trafford. The pair are so close that Brailsford actually delivered a speech to Newcastle Unitedâs players early on in the Ashworth tenure. Now it looks like Brailsford will be calling in a favour of his own at United: come and turn them back into Premier League champions. Itâs a tough pitch for Ashworth to turn down.",Itâs a tough pitch for Ashworth to turn down.

The midfielder has been mentioned in France by multiple outlets as a potential target for PSG as they look to move past Kylian Mbappeâs departure, but he will be going nowhere.  The Blaugrana have made it clear they are not willing to listen to offers for Gavi, who has a â¬1b release clause, and now Sport are reporting that Gavi is not willing to listen to offers either. Often these days clubs attempt to convince the player of a move first, and then negotiate with the club knowing they are in a tough position. That will not be the case for Gavi though, despite his excellent relationship with Luis Enrique. The young midfielder was showing his best form yet when he was cruelly struck down by an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Unlike most of Barcelonaâs squad though, he appears to be one of the few the Blaugrana are not willing to part with as they look to fund another rebuild of their squad.","The young midfielder was showing his best form yet when he was cruelly struck down by an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

It should come as no surprise that David Moyes ' long-standing interest - having previously tried to sign both Phillips and Raphinha from Leeds - helped sway the highly-coveted midfield lynchpin as transfer rivals battled for his signature.  The treble-winner added: ""I think it was just the size of the club and the manager influenced me a lot. He told me heâs been after me for the last few transfer windows. I just felt like if I wasnât going to play at City, I want to go to a club where Iâm wanted.  ""Not that City didnât want me but I wanted to go somewhere where the manager was really keen and where he really wanted me. It sounded like a really good group down here. I want to feel like Iâm at home wherever I go.""  Phillips also consulted his England midfield partner Declan Rice before finalising his decision and unsurprisingly the ex-West Ham captain offered a glowing review of the place he used to call home. Meanwhile, Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate cynically advised his star against a move overseas ahead of upcoming European Championships in Germany despite a formal offer from Juventus. Phillips explained: ""So I spoke to Gareth probably about a month before the January transfer window opened. I just said what teams were interested in me at that time, that I knew about. I didnât know about West Ham, to be honest. I knew that West Ham would probably come in a bit later in the window. I spoke to him about a few teams.  ""I mentioned Juventus and I mentioned Newcastle, which could have been a possibility and he basically told me that heâs not going to tell me what to do but he said he thinks the Premier League is a lot more difficult, a more competitive league.  ""He said to be playing in the Premier League versus playing anywhere elseâ¦ itâs just that little bit of a step down in quality. So yeah, he influenced me to stay in England. And West Ham came in and I thought it was the right place to go."" Phillips categorically states he ""definitely wouldn't"" have made the England squad had he decided to stay put until the end of the season. The ex-Leeds anchorman is also humble enough to admit that he's ""still caught in-between Pep's way of playing"" as he slowly gets to grips with the tactical fundamentals of Moyes-ball So far, his obsession with possession has proven to be his own worst enemy, adding: ""In the last few games I've made mistakes, simply because I'm trying to get used to the people around me and the way we play ""Against Bournemouth I felt very lethargic, a little bit heavy in my legs towards the end of the first half. It just comes down to game-time and now I'm grasping the idea, hopefully the mistakes will now stop."" Phillips, who received heartfelt pointers from Marcelo Bielsa during an emotional phone call amid his darkest City days, remains convinced he's become a better player under Guardiola - despite his stark lack of minutes. He said of Bielsa: ""I spoke to him after the Leicester game [April 2023] at home. I made a mistake and I just felt s*** really. I remember going home and just being really upset with myself. ""It was probably the low-point confidence-wise since I'd been at City but then I spoke to him and he called me back via a translator and we had a conversation for around half an hour. Yeah, it was a good conversation to be honest."" Rather fittingly, Bielsa disclosed to Phillips that he'd watched every game he'd been involved in for City since his Â£45million transfer from Leeds in July 2022. Even though Phillips reflects that he's his own biggest critic - he isn't fussed about perceptions, stating: ""To be honest I'm not really bothered about the narrative anyone has towards me. I just wanted to play football and become happy again whether that was with Man City or West Ham. ""The last 18 months have been long but I learned more in those 18 months than I have in my whole career. I donât regret signing for City though. It has grown me as a person and as a player."" Moyes' statement signing has the chance to extend his City legacy beyond medals this weekend when West Ham entertain London rivals Arsenal, who they have already beaten on two separate occasions this season.","Moyes' statement signing has the chance to extend his City legacy beyond medals this weekend when West Ham entertain London rivals Arsenal, who they have already beaten on two separate occasions this season."
695,Man U to attract Dan Ashworth: CRAIG HOPE on Saudis losing top sporting director,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-U-to-attract-Dan-Ashworth-CRAIG-HOPE-on-Saudis-losing-top-sporting-director/3301851,2 days ago,"When Dan Ashworth gave his opening speech to Newcastleâs recruitment team at a hotel overlooking the River Tyne, he told them he would not be at the club forever. There was, he said, an optimal period for a sporting director to do his work before leaving with his processes in place.  He, nor anyone connected to Newcastle, believed that time would come just 20 months later. The truth is, Ashworthâs work at St Jamesâ Park is not done. Far from it, in fact. And that, in part, is one of the reasons he will likely leave for Manchester United. What Ashworth hoped to implement at Newcastle will take longer than he expected, and some of what he had hoped to influence has been beyond his control. He has not been handed the keys to the kingdom. Rather, they will forever reside in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where we can reveal Ashworth attended meetings with the clubâs majority owners at the start of last month. There, it is likely he was asked about his own future, given Mail Sport reported before Christmas that the 52-year-old was expected to become Man Unitedâs new sporting director, once Sir Jim Ratcliffeâs INEOS deal was ratified. He is also close to Sir Dave Brailsford and a formal approach is now expected within St Jamesâ. But why would Ashworth want to go? It is important to state that, to our knowledge, there has been no fallout and all relations remain good, even if there is a want among Newcastleâs hierarchy to avoid a period of prolonged speculation. If Man United want him, they need to knock at the front door. When that approach comes, we expect Ashworth will tell his current employers he wishes to go. It is thought Newcastle would demand compensation in excess of Â£6million and insist on a period of gardening leave of up to a year. Their preference would be for him to remain.   But at Old Trafford, sources say, Ashworth would have far greater control. There is the lure of an increased salary, being closer to home and, significantly, the draw of being the man charged with re-aligning the biggest club in the world. Those are the pull factors, but what about the push? It all comes back to autonomy. Ashworth uses an analogy about being âthe man at the centre of the wheel, connecting the spokes of the different departmentsâ. At Newcastle, however, there is more than one wheel, and all roads lead back to Riyadh. Decision-making at the club is âprocess drivenâ, and very little is signed off without the say-so of Saudi Arabiaâs Public Investment Fund. This can often take weeks. Sources also say there are âblurred linesâ over the original plans and remit to which Ashworth signed up when joining from Brighton in the summer of 2022. There are also the UK-based owners - Amanda Staveley, Mehrdad Ghodoussi and Jamie Reuben. Again, sources insist Ashworth has a good relationship with all concerned, but his approach to business is measured, whereas others can sometimes be led by emotion, even if well intended. With Eddie Howe, meanwhile, Ashworth is not part of the managerâs inner circle. That is not to suggest friction - they get on well and there is mutual respect - but that is just how Howe has always operated. Along with coaches Jason Tindall, Stephen Purches, Graeme Jones and nephew Andy Howe - head of technical scouting - he has a close-knit group in which he confides. Ashworth arrived eight months after the head coach and the chain of command was already established. Howe has the final say on transfers and, contrary to wider belief, Ashworth is not a talent-spotter. Rather, he oversees recruitment and negotiates and concludes deals. At Newcastle, his focus has been as much on revamping the scouting network, from academy to first team, both domestically and globally.     But to the backdrop of his efforts have been financial fair play rules and the frustration of a strict limit on spending, evidenced by a January window in which Newcastle made no signings. For Ashworth, there will be a realisation that progress at Man United, by comparison, would be accelerated. Ironically, we understand there are scouting meetings on Tyneside this week, with foreign scouts flying in for debriefs and planning summits led by Ashworth. They usually have a group meal the night before attending a home game, and Newcastle host Bournemouth on Saturday. For those present, it could well have the feel of the Last Supper.","Ironically, we understand there are scouting meetings on Tyneside this week, with foreign scouts flying in for debriefs and planning summits led by Ashworth.

696,Leverkusen 3-0 Bayern: 5 pts clear at top of table! Alonso's side destroy Bayern,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Leverkusen-3-0-Bayern-5-pts-clear-at-top-of-table-Alonsos-side-destroy-Bayern/3297713,11 Feb,"Jeremie Frimpong fired into an empty net in stoppage time to cap Bayer Leverkusenâs outstanding 3-0 win over Bayern Munich as they celebrated carnival weekend in the Rhineland by moving five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga.  Josip Stanisic, the man on loan from Bayern, opened the scoring in the 18th minute before Alex Grimaldo doubled the advantage five minutes into the second half, but Frimpong added an exclamation mark after Manuel Neuer came up for a corner and Leverkusen broke to punish him. Bayern had more of the ball but throughout the night it always felt as though Xabi Alonsoâs side were the more dangerous, and this was a huge statement in their bid to win a first Bundesliga title and banish the nickname Vizekuzen â a mark of the five times they have finished runners-up. WHAT A WIN!!!!!!!! BAYER 04 LEVERKUSEN 90+5' | 3-0 | #B04FCB #Bayer04 pic.twitter.com/fxM4EQkX4X â Bayer 04 Leverkusen (@bayer04_en) February 10, 2024 The match at the BayArena kicked off eight minutes late after fans threw toy balls and other items onto the pitch as part of ongoing protests against the prospect of outside investment into the Bundesliga, and once play began it was Bayern who appeared to be on the front foot. But while Leverkusen were happy to invite the visitors on to them, they were simply waiting for the moment to counter. Their first shot at goal came in the 11th minute but Amine Adliâs effort lacked the power to trouble Neuer. Adli threatened again seven minutes later before Kim Min-jae got a foot in just in time, but Bayern were asleep from the resulting throw-in and were made to pay. Robert Andrich drilled in a low ball across the face of goal and the Bayern defence stood still as Stanisic arrived to fire home, left all alone by Sacho Boey, usually a right-back but deployed on the left here in his second appearance since joining from Galatasaray last month. Adli had a superb chance to get a second just before half-time as Granit Xhakaâs pin-point pass put him clean through on goal, but Dayot Upamecano recovered to get a toe on the ball, poking it back to Neuer. It took only five minutes of the second half for the second to arrive. Grimaldo played a neat one-two with Nathan Tella to carve open the Bayern defence before beating Neuer at his near post with a rising shot. Germany Soccer Bundesliga  Bayern were rocking, and there was chaos in their penalty area soon after, with Eric Dierâs cross hitting the arm of Leon Goretzka before bobbling back to Neuer, with a VAR check for handball coming to nothing. Grimaldo hit the crossbar direct from a corner just after the hour as the ball dramatically dipped, but it bounced to safety. Bayern tried to up the ante as Thomas Tuchel turned to his bench but struggled to create any real opportunities for a frustrated Harry Kane. Instead, Leverkusen looked more likely to score again. Frimpong had already hit a post at the end of one late counter-attack, but had the final say after Neuer failed to get on the end of the corner and he raced down the pitch to fire into the unguarded net. 0' The match is about to start!   9' Dier makes an important clearanceï¼   10' CLOSE!

697,Micah Richards jokes Kylian Mbappe has 'more of an aura than Thierry Henry,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Micah-Richards-jokes-Kylian-Mbappe-has-more-of-an-aura-than-Thierry-Henry/3302025,1 day ago,"Micah Richards has teased Thierry Henry claiming Kylian Mbappe has 'more of an aura' than the Arsenal legend, before insisting that the Paris-Saint Germain forward needs to leave the club.  The 25-year-old's contract with the Ligue 1 side is set to expire this summer and seems to be edging closer to a move to Real Madrid. Recent reports have also suggested that Mbappe could be 'willing to join Arsenal' amid 'doubts over offers from the LaLiga club'. Henry, meanwhile, is widely regarded as one of the greatest players to have ever featured in the Premier League, scoring 228 goals in 377 appearances for the Gunners. Like Mbappe, he also won a World Cup with France, and is also renowned for being one of the coolest strikers to have graced the game. Despite that, Richards claimed Mbappe might have more style than the legendary France international. The former Man City star told CBS Sports: âHonestly looking at him [Mbappe], his aura, heâs justâ¦ he reminds me of a young Titi [Henry]. He really does. But I think heâs got a little bit moreâ¦â   His statement prompted loud cries from Jamie Carragher, Kate Abdo and Henry inside the CBS Sports studio. Carragher was overheard on the broadcast saying: âNo! Woah, woah, woah.â Richards came back to clarify his statement, saying: âI mean style, not as a player â calm down, calm down.â The ex-Man City star addressed Henry directly, stating: âTiti [Henry] I wasnât disrespecting you by the way,' Richards said. 'I mean I was talking about va va voom!' Abdo: 'So you donât feel like he has style? What do you mean by that?' Richards: 'I said he could have more. He [Henry] has got loads of style, but Kiki [Mbappe] is you know...' The cameras then turned to Henry, who hilariously hit back at Richards, stating in response: 'Itâs because I nutmegged himâ¦ Honestly.' The former Man City defender has previously recounted the moment Henry out-skilled him, claiming that the Frenchman had 'winked' at him after passing the ball between his legs. Mbappe, meanwhile, joined PSG from Monaco initially on a loan transfer in 2017, but has gone on to score a phenomenal 242 goals in 289 matches, but has never won the Champions League with the club. With PSG in action tonight against Real Sociedad in the knockout stages of the tournament Abdo pressed Richards on his comments again, stating: 'There may be no better way to end his time at PSG than delivering the Champions League to them, Micah?' Richards replied: âYeah itâs going to be tough though, but itâs not a one-man team, heâs had Neymar heâs had Messi.    'Itâd be a great send-off of course it would.But itâs not about one man. I just love him because genuinely heâs the best player on earth right now. People were talking about him earlier in the season saying: âhe wasnât doing that well, heâs gone through a bit of a blipââ¦ Heâs scored 30 goals this season in 29 appearances! He lumped praise on the PSG star, saying: 'Honestly I get so excited talking about him because when everyone doubts him he just delivers. Even when I doubted him in one game he shook me up. I just think heâs a joy to watch. He Can play either wing. So quick, electric. 'He can score goals. He is an all-round superstar. I love him in a PSG shirt but he needs to go and do better things and be winning Champions Leagues, and it looks like it could be Real Madrid.'","'He can score goals. He is an all-round superstar.

698,Footballers inside the ring: Man Utd legend Roy Keane went UNDEFEATED,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Footballers-inside-the-ring-Man-Utd-legend-Roy-Keane-went-UNDEFEATED/3302510,18 hours ago,"To make it to the highest levels as a professional footballer, stamina, discipline and work ethic are essential attributes.  When combined with the kind of natural athleticism also seen in fighters, it is perhaps not surprising that, throughout the years, there have been crossovers from the pitch to the ring. Wherever it is formative years spent in an amateur gym, a charity fight after retirement, or a full-blown career change, several footballers have tested their skills in the sweet science. For better or worse these players stepped away from the protection of a team game, and challenged themselves in one of sport's most unforgiving avenues. With the news that Wayne Rooney is debating stepping into the world of influencer boxing to sign with KSI's Misfits promotion, we took a look back at eight players who tried their hand at boxing. Renowned as one of England's greatest-ever defensive talents, Rio Ferdinand enjoyed a glittering career across two decades as a professional footballer. The centre-back twice broke the British transfer record, and upon arrival at Old Trafford in 2002 quickly established himself as one of the club's stalwarts in the latter years of Sir Alex Ferguson's all-conquering reign. After more than a decade in Manchester, Ferdinand endured a decidedly less successful year at QPR before calling time on his career in 2015. Although that retirement marked the end of his football career, Ferdinand's sporting ambitions found a new venture in professional boxing. Aged 39, in 2017 Ferdinand announced he would transition to boxing with a documentary set to be filmed following his transition to a career in combat sports. Less than a year after embarking on a training regime, Ferdinand was denied a license to box by the British Boxing Board of Control and retired without stepping inside the ring, and has since flourished on screens as a pundit, appearing most regularly on TNT Sport.  Joining his former Manchester United team-mate on this list, Wayne Rooney could yet step into the ring this year if negotiations with Misfits boxing prove fruitful. Unlike Ferdinand however, Rooney does have a background in pugilism, having trained in the sport as a youth before becoming a teenage sensation at Everton. Despite his various successes in football Rooney's love of boxing never wavered during his career, and he was frequently spotted at high-profile fights and maintained a close friendship with Ricky Hatton. But the former United captain's love of the sport infamously wasn't limited to just spectating. In 2015, footage emerged of Rooney being knocked unconscious whilst sparring in his kitchen with former United teammate Phil Bardsley. Rooney saw the funny side though, parodying the incident with a notorious goal celebration after netting just days later against Tottenham.  The recipient of 36 England caps, Wayne Bridge would have no doubt won countless more had his sporting prime not seen him forced to compete with Ashley Cole for a place in the national team. Having won everything available to him domestically at Chelsea, Bridge would spend time at Manchester City, West Ham, Sunderland, Brighton and Reading before hanging up his boots in 2014. Despite his career on the pitch being over, Bridge remained active and elected to showcase his budding skills inside the ring for charity at Sport Relief 2018. Taking on reality TV personality Spencer Matthews, Bridge dominated his hapless opponent and twice forced the Made In Chelsea star to the canvas. While Matthews would survive to see the final bell, Bridge dominated and was rightfully declared the winner after three two-minute rounds.  Known for his intensity, aggression and seemingly-endless stamina it is perhaps no surprise that Roy Keane briefly donned the gloves in his youth. Taking up the sport aged nine, Keane followed his brother into a local amateur boxing gym in Cork. While his brother went full-steam ahead with training, the younger Keane was forced to juggle his boxing commitments with a burgeoning football career for local side Rockmount. Though his stint in the ring was short-lived Roy did have several amateur fights, winning all of them before concentrating on his football. Speaking about the experience on Sky's Stick to Football podcast Keane expressed his love for the sport. 'My brother had about 50 amateur fights but I had about four fights. I was unbeaten, you know what I mean. It was great, brilliant when you were younger with training, I loved everything about it and the discipline.'  Much like Keane, Tommy Martin was once faced with a decision as to whether to continue his footballing career or seriously pursue boxing. The Chelmsford-born light-welterweight was on the books at Peterborough United after emerging as a talented young goalkeeper. However, despite being offered a scholarship by the Posh, Martin knew his true affections lay elsewhere. 'As soon as I stepped into the gym, I thought 'I don't want to be on a cold, muddy football pitch - I want to be in the gym punching someone's head in'. Martin told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. Making his professional debut in 2012, Martin would soon be recognised as one of Britain's premier talents at 140lbs defeating Ricky Boylan for the English title in 2015 becoming the youngest fighter in history to capture the belt. His in-ring career would ultimately end in tragedy, however. Just one year after his historic title win Martin faced John Wayne Hibbert for the Commonwealth belt and was knocked out in the twelfth and final round of a back-and-forth clash. Martin suffered a bleed on the brain during the bout, and was subsequently forced to retire from the sport.  Unquestionably the most successful fighter to feature on this list, Katie Taylor has combined an unprecedentedly successful amateur run with multiple world titles as a professional. However, before any of her boxing successes the 37-year-old's first showcase on the international stage came as a midfielder. After playing the sport as a schoolgirl, Taylor played for various sides in the Dublin area and represented the Republic or Ireland at multiple youth levels. Taylor then went on to make 11 appearances for the senior side, scoring for her country in their Euro 2009 qualifying clashes with Italy and Hungary. Domestically Taylor also won a treble with Peamount United as the club triumphed in the Dublin Women's Soccer League, the DWSL Premier Cup and the FAI Women's Cup in 2010. All the while she was carving out a career as one of the most decorated amateurs in the history of women's boxing, counting an Olympic gold amongst her numerous titles before turning pro in 2016.  Unlike some of his contemporaries on this list, when Leon McKenzie opted to embark on a boxing career after hanging up his boots, he did it the hard way. An industrious forward that netted in all four divisions of English football, McKenzie was an integral member of Nigel Worthington's Norwich side that was promoted to the Premier League in 2004, netting nine times in just 12 starts. Once in the top-flight McKenzie would register a further seven goals as the Canaries' joint-top scorer but the club couldn't avoid relegation at the first attempt. After briefly dropping into non-league football McKenzie decided on a career change, and went on to make his professional boxing debut aged 35 in 2013. Initially cutting his teeth against journeymen, McKenzie shortly progressed up the ranks and earned a shot at the English super-middleweight title with a first-round stoppage of Kelvin Young. Though he would ultimately be unsuccessful in his pursuit of domestic glory, McKenzie's 8-2-1 record is unquestionably respectable, particularly given his age when he first laced up the gloves.  While Curtis Woodhouse may not be the best footballer to feature on this list, nor the most accomplished fighter, his accomplishments in both earn him the title as one of football's greatest boxers. Beginning his career with York, Woodhouse would soon be snapped up by Sheffield United, making his senior debut with the Blades in 1997 before going on to join Birmingham.  In the West Midlands Woodhouse would make 28 appearances in the 2001-02 season as Steve Bruce led the club to fifth in the Championship, though he would be left out of the squad as they defeated Norwich on penalties in the play-off final. Though his opportunities would prove limited in the top flight, Woodhouse did make several substitute appearances in the Premier before departing St Andrew's in search of more playing time. Spells at Peterborough, Hull and Grimsby followed though he later stated he had 'fallen out of love with football' and opted to move to a career in the ring aged 26. Initially accused of being little more than a gimmick, Woodhouse soon proved himself by winning multiple domestic titles, including the British light-welterweight belt before retiring in 2017 with  a record of 24 wins and 7 losses.","Initially accused of being little more than a gimmick, Woodhouse soon proved himself by winning multiple domestic titles, including the British light-welterweight belt before retiring in 2017 with  a record of 24 wins and 7 losses."
699,Onanaâs blunt response to January transfer offers revealed after Arsenal links,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Onana%E2%80%99s-blunt-response-to-January-transfer-offers-revealed-after-Arsenal-links/3302149,1 day ago,"Amadou Onana swiftly rejected a January move amid interest from Arsenal, his agent has confirmed.  The Everton star was at the heart of plenty of interest in the winter window. Manchester United were touted as potential suitors, while the Gunners were contenders for his services. However, Onana opted to stick around with his current club as they battle for Premier League survival. And it has now been revealed that an exit from Goodison Park was a realistic prospect in January but the former Lille midfielder was not interested in a mid-season switch. His sister and agent Melissa is quoted saying via Sport Witness: âWe could have left this winter, but we once again sat down and asked the question whether itâs the right time, if the player is ready. My job is to put opportunities on the table. âIn the end, heâs the one who makes the choice because itâs his life and his career. I put the opportunities on the table and he said âNo, I want to stay at Everton and I want to continue to fightâ.â While the player was not keen on a switch, Melissa was also not too enamoured with attempting to engineer a transfer in January due desperation in the winter market. She added: âIâm lucky that my brother is intelligent, which isnât the case for all players, so I give him the pros and the cons of a situation thatâs on the table. âWe talk about it, he asks me my opinion, and I say âthis is what I thinkâ. Then, he makes his choice. Personally, Iâm also not a fan of transfers during the winter. âOften, itâs to put a stop to a bad situation. Itâs clubs that are trying to turn a situation around after the transfers they did in the summer. They are clubs that are bleeding, trying to find a plaster.â Since then, Onana has continued to be a key player in Evertonâs attempt to stave off relegation from the Premier League under Sean Dyche. The nine-time Belgium international has made 25 appearances in all competitions for Everton this term and scored twice. His contract at Goodison Park is set to run until the summer of 2027. Since joining Everton from French side Lille, he has racked up 60 appearances for the Toffees.","His contract at Goodison Park is set to run until the summer of 2027.

Ronaldo was a team-mate of Ferdinand's at Old Trafford between 2003 to 2009 before returning for a second spell in 2021. And Ferdinand opened up on how he had been worried about Diogo Dalot and whether he was good enough for United. The defender has made 139 appearances for the Red Devils since joining for Â£19million from Porto in 2018, and has impressed in recent weeks, with his performances including a sumptuous cross for Scott McTominay's winner against Aston Villa on Sunday. And Ferdinand revealed he was previously not convinced by Dalot - who is a team-mate of Ronaldo for Portugal - but was reassured by the 39-year-old Al-Nassr star.   âDalot needs a special mention,â Ferdinand said on his podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents FIVE. âHe is someone I doubted early on. âI remember speaking to Cristiano Ronaldo and said, ""Is he really that good?"". And Cristiano said he will work hard, make himself better and 100 per cent improve. âHe saw it behind the scenes so he knew that. I said to Darren Fletcher when I was at the training ground the other day that he has really impressed me. âDarren said that he is a worker, heâs going to make himself the player he needs to be.' Ferdinand went onto add how although Dalot is not the finished product yet, he felt he was on the right path to becoming a key player for Erik ten Hag. âI still think defensively he probably needs to work a little bit,' he added. 'But yesterday (on Sunday) I thought he was very good defensively (against Aston Villa). âWith the ball, that cross, if we have players running onto them, the forwards will make the runs and we will score more goals.â   Things have not always been easy for Dalot at Old Trafford, with the full-back shipped out on loan to AC Milan in 2020. However, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka's continued injury problems, he has made the right back spot his own this season, while he has often filled in at left back too, amid an availability crisis at the back for United.

701,Nice defender Todibo remains open to EPL move amid Chelsea and Man United links,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Nice-defender-Todibo-remains-open-to-EPL-move-amid-Chelsea-and-Man-United-links/3299251,11 Feb,"Nice defender Jean-Clair Todibo has revealed he is yet to make a decision on a potential move to the Premier League in the summer amid being linked with moves to Chelsea and Manchester United.  The Frenchman has starred for his team this season with Nice currently second in the Ligue 1 standings, but still 11-points adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Todibo was tipped for a potential transfer to the English top-flight last year and a move to Man United could now be easier to conduct given Nice owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's recent investment in the English giant's. The 24-year-old is enjoying his strongest season in France since moving to the club from Barcelona three-years previous and has starred with impressive defensive performances to help the club keep 11 league clean sheets this season. Todibo has now given an update on his future ahead of the summer transfer window opening and clarified his situation to avoid giving 'false hope' to Nice supporters and any interested parties.  'I am at Nice and we're having a great season. I don't have my head elsewhere. If I did it would be difficult for me personally and for the group too. 'I feel really good at Nice. We'll see what happens in the summer but we're not there yet. I don't want to get ahead of myself. I don't want to give false hope. For now, I'm here at Nice.' 'Football moves quickly, you never know what's going to happen. I'll wait until the summer to make my decision. 'If my decision is to stay, I'll announce it, if it is to leave, I'll announce it too and I'll thank everyone, but we're not there yet.'   Todibo has significantly improved in the south of France since joining from Barcelona following a spell in Barcelona that saw his first-team opportunities limited. Other top European clubs are expected to challenge Chelsea and United for his signature and the centre-back further revealed how he wants to leave something 'beautiful' behind if he does depart Nice. 'There are important games coming up. The goal is that if it is to be my final season at Nice, then I want to leave here having done something beautiful with the club,' he continued. 'The supporters and the club deserve players who give everything on the pitch, and to achieve something substantial. Personally, if I am to leave, I want to leave something good behind.'","'The supporters and the club deserve players who give everything on the pitch, and to achieve something substantial.

702,Tottenham equal second-longest scoring run by netting in 36th consecutive game,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Tottenham-equal-second-longest-scoring-run-by-netting-in-36th-consecutive-game/3299315,11 Feb,"Tottenham scored for a 36th successive Premier League game in Saturdayâs 2-1 win over Brighton to equal the second-longest run in Premier League history. Here, the PA news agency looks at how they have done it and the record run still in front of them. After losing 1-0 to Wolves in March, Tottenham scored in their final 12 games of last season â even as they sacked manager Antonio Conte and then caretaker Cristian Stellini, the latter following a shambolic 6-1 defeat to Newcastle. They finished the season with Ryan Mason in charge and have not let up this term under a fourth manager in Ange Postecoglou, netting at least once in every game so far â 51 goals in 24 games, to add to their 24 in last seasonâs portion of the scoring run for a total of 75. They have also conceded 63 at the other end and have kept only six clean sheets along the way as they rival Saturdayâs opponents Brighton as the Premier Leagueâs great entertainers â Albionâs own sequences of 32 consecutive games without being shut out and 20 in which both teams had scored were ended by Decemberâs 2-0 loss to Arsenal. Postecoglouâs side have matched Manchester Unitedâs run from December 2007 to November 2008, and Liverpool from March 2019 to February 2020. Spurs would need to score in every game for the rest of this season and the first five of next term to equal the record of 55, set by rivals Arsenal from May 2001 to November 2002. Son Heung-min celebrates scoring against Nottingham Forest in March  Captain Son Heung-min is Spursâ top scorer in those games with 17 goals, joined in double figures by the departed Harry Kane with 12 and Richarlison on 11. They have had 19 different scorers in all, in addition to own goals by opponents Lisandro Martinez, Joel Matip and Joel Ward. Pedro Porro has made the most appearances, featuring in 34 of the 36 games. Their stand-out performances in front of goal saw them beat Burnley 5-2 in September as well as 4-1 wins over Newcastle this season and Leeds last. They have scored three goals on six occasions, netting twice 17 times and once on 10 occasions, averaging 2.08 goals per game. That compares to 2.13 for Arsenal on their 55-game run, which encompassed the last game of 2000-01, their entire 2001-02 title win and the first 16 games of the following campaign. The Gunners, though, conceded barely a goal a game (56) compared to 1.75 for Spurs. Arsene Wengerâs side surprisingly had only 15 different scorers, plus four opposition own goals. Thierry Henry racked up 31 of their 117 goals, with Sylvain Wiltord on 18, Freddie Ljungberg 15 and 10 apiece for Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp.","Arsene Wengerâs side surprisingly had only 15 different scorers, plus four opposition own goals.

703,Kylian Mbappe's camp 'are having DOUBTS over Real Madrid's offer,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kylian-Mbappes-camp-are-having-DOUBTS-over-Real-Madrids-offer/3301265,13 Feb,"Kylian Mbappe is yet to commit his future to either Paris Saint-Germain or Real Madrid, with the striker's team reportedly having doubts over the deal offered by the LaLiga giants.  The French international has been heavily linked with a move away from the Parc des Princes and Real Madrid has been touted as his most likely destination. However, PSG are keen to keep hold of their superstar and tie him to a new deal. Reports earlier in the week had suggested that a deal between Mbappe and Real Madrid had been agreed, but subsequent developments suggest the striker is still sitting on the fence. According to The Athletic, Mbappe has known the conditions Madrid are willing to offer him since the start of January. However, his team are not convinced by the deal the LaLiga giants have tabled. It is believed Madrid's proposal was lower than what was offered during the club's previous negotiations over a transfer from PSG in May 2022. Although, the new deal would still see the striker become the highest-paid player in Madrid's squad.   According to the Athletics' sources, Mbappe was offered a â¬130million (Â£110m; $140m signing bonus and a salary of â¬26m per year in 2022 when they began negotiating. Meanwhile, PSG presented Mbappe with a range of contracts including long-term and short-term deals over the last couple of months to encourage the 25-year-old to extend his stay in France. The proposed deals would see Mbappe remain on the same salary he is on now - which is said to be â¬75million after tax, before any bonuses, according to The Athletic's sources. Madrid can not match PSG's offer but the club's president Florentino Perez reportedly remains confident he can convince Mbappe to join the club on the salary provided in their current offer. Mbappe is currently being advised by his mother Fayza Lamari. She has become his agent once again after newspapers in Spain had reported late last year that she had to stop representing her son because of FIFA's regulations on agents. While those rules have subsequently been 'relaxed' Lamari recently stepped back into her position as his agent and will likely play a huge role in the next step of his footballing journey. The striker's mother is well known for playing hard ball when it comes to transfer business, with Lamari having also previously played hardball with her son over his wages. Mbappe has been free to negotiate with other clubs since January 1 after entering the final six months of his PSG contract. However, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi also openly stated that he wanted the winger to stay. Speaking to RMC, Al-Khelaifi said: 'Look, I'm not hiding anything. For sure I want Mbappe to stay. For me he is the best in the world and for me the best club for Kylian is Paris.' Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal also made an attempt to sign Mbappe during the 2023 summer transfer window, offering the striker a Â£173.2m-per-year deal to move to the Middle East. But, it seems as though Real is too much of an enticing option for Mbappe given the fact he has turned down other clubs and returned to the negotiating table after previously rejecting them. Equally, winning both individual and team honours is another appeal for the forward, who believes his best chance of winning the Champions League could be with Real Madrid.   ",
704,"Amid interest from Chelsea, how much should Barcelona sell Frenkie de Jong for?",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Amid-interest-from-Chelsea-how-much-should-Barcelona-sell-Frenkie-de-Jong-for/3299674,11 Feb,"Due to their ongoing financial woes, itâs looking more and more likely that Barcelona will need to make at least one big sale during the upcoming summer transfer window. There are a number of candidates who will fit this role, including Jules Kounde, Andreas Christensen and Raphinha.  At this stage, the one that perhaps looks most likely to leave is Frenkie de Jong. The Dutch midfielder was previously seen as an untouchable player, although it now appears that Barcelona have changed their stance in the last few months, especially after it was reported that he blanked a contract offer from the club. If Barcelona do decide to put de Jong on the market, they wouldnât have a hard time generating interest. The Premier League would be a likely destination â Manchester United were previously very close to signing him in the summer of 2022, before a deal broke down in the personal terms stage of negotiations. However, itâs not Man United that have emerged as early contenders, but rather the free-spending Chelsea. According to Todofichajes, the West London side are prepared to pay â¬100m to sign the 26-year-old, which is likely to be in the ballpark of what Barcelona deem as an acceptable offer. Due to their financial problems, Barcelona will be aiming to get as much as possible for de Jong, should he be the one that is selected as a possible departure. While they will demand a very high price for someone that is widely considered to be one of the best midfielders in the world, they do not hold all the cards. This is because de Jongâs contract is set to rise from next season as a result of deferred wages that he is owed. It would make him Barcelonaâs highest earner, and perhaps understandably, the club is uneasy about paying these out for the next two years. That is a reason why he may be sold this summer, as it would allow the Blaugrana to save a fair amount of money, while also (likely) receiving a massive transfer fee. However, because of this scenario, there would be a degree of desperation, which interested clubs could be aware of. As such, this could force Barcelona into accepting an offer lower than they would hope â but, de Jong will have two years left on his contract by the time the summer rolls around, so theyâre not exactly in a bad position either. â¬100m would probably be a price that Barcelona accept, should Chelsea indeed offer that much for de Jong. In terms of the current squad, his sale would make the most sense, because of the other midfield options currently in the first team â now, it just remains to be seen whether a sale does actually happen.","â¬100m would probably be a price that Barcelona accept, should Chelsea indeed offer that much for de Jong.

The Reds started the weekend in sixth place in the Premier League and face a trip to high-flying Aston Villa. âUnited were fined Â£256,000 last summer for failing to meet UEFA's FFP regulations.

708,"Rice identifies Arsenal's ""special, special talent"" after Arteta ""trust"" claim",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Rice-identifies-Arsenals-special-special-talent-after-Arteta-trust-claim/3300768,12 Feb,"Declan Rice has heaped praise on Arsenal youngster Ethan Nwaneri, who made just his second Premier League appearance on Sunday.  The 16-year-old was brought on with 15 minutes still to play as the Gunners decimated their London rivals West Ham with a 6-0 win at the home of the Hammers. By the time Nwaneri was introduced, Arsenal had already bagged all six goals and boss Mikel Arteta deemed it a suitable time to get the teenager on the pitch for the first time since September of last year. The Hale End graduate impressed, as despite his age Nwaneri was more than comfortable when it came to getting on the ball and attacking the West Ham backline. Arsenal's most talented players, the likes of Rice and captain Martin Odegaard, clearly trust him if the passing stats are anything to go by. Odegaard and Nwaneri exchanged passes 15 time, which is arguably the highest compliment that can be paid to the talented teen. After the game, the youngster took to Instagram to upload some pictures of his performance. If any Gunners fan wanted an insight into what the senior stars really think of Nwaneri, look no further than the comment section. Ben White opted for the 'praise hands' emoji, while William Saliba instead added three fire emojis. Bukayo Saka, a man who knows just how hard it is to break into the Arsenal first-team, wrote ""baller"", but it was perhaps Rice's assessment that spoke volumes. The Gunners record-signing added: ""Special, special talent."" It is clear that Arsenal's established stars think incredibly highly of Nwaneri, as explained by Arteta himself during his post-match media duties. âThere is something that you have to earn in your team and that is the trust of your team-mates. I had two things. One, the players on the bench whispering 'Bring Ethan in!', which is a great thing to hear,"" Arteta said. ""The other thing is for your team-mates to give you the ball all the time. If they do that, it's because they really trust you and you only have to see how many times he was involved in that. So itâs a great sign."" Nwaneri made history last season when he became the youngest player to star in a Premier League game at just 15 years and 181 days. Whether he features in another league game this season is unknown, but with the backing of Arteta, Rice and Odegaard - the future is bright for the teenage midfielder.","Nwaneri made history last season when he became the youngest player to star in a Premier League game at just 15 years and 181 days.

709,Conte says Kane deserves to win trophies & is a more complete player than before,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Conte-says-Kane-deserves-to-win-trophies--is-a-more-complete-player-than-before/3302557,18 hours ago,"Antonio Conte has claimed that moving to Bayern Munich has made Harry Kane a better player than he was at Tottenham.  The England captain became Spurs' all-time top goal-scorer in 2022-23 before departing the north London outfit in the summer, sealing a seismic Â£100million switch to Bayern Munich. Kane has since made light work of the transition to the Bundesliga, scoring 24 times in just 21 appearances and breaking club records in the process as he instantly makes good on the investment. He has however recently hit a stumbling block in his progress in Bavaria, with Bild slamming the striker with scathing reviews in back-to-back outings as Bayern hit a snag in their pursuit of silverware. But his former boss Conte has been quick to dampen any claims that the move might not work out for Kane, who has notably never won a trophy in his club career, despite his inarguable stature within the game.  'We're talking about a player who is amazing,' Conte told the Daily Telegraph in an exclusive interview. 'This opportunity to play for Bayern Munich made him better. No doubt about his capacity to score. 'I think he needed to go and to change, to find another club, another mentality, another situation. It was important for him. 'He deserves to win trophies and we are talking about one of the best strikers in the world. He is one of the best I've worked with, for sure. He's a good guy and a good person too. 'He needed this new experience, another chance. Now he is a more complete player than before.' While the rest of the Tottenham side appeared to stagnate under Conte, who favoured a more defensive approach, Kane had yet another stunning campaign last term. The Three Lions talisman netted 30 goals in 38 Premier League outings, as well as another three assists, as he remained one of the bright sparks in a poor season that ended with an eighth place finish. In total, in Conte's 75 games in charge at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Kane netted 43 times and assisted 14 more. The Italian also admitted he has no regrets about blasting Tottenham players in his infamous rant that eventually led to the Italian leaving the club last year.   Rewind nearly 12 months and Conte was fuming after his Spurs side blew a two-goal lead against St Mary's and draw 3-3 with Southampton who would go on to be relegated to the Championship. The former Premier League-winning-manager with Chelsea was on thin ice amidst tensions within the Spurs camp leading up to the game, but that ice then cracked after his post-match rant, Conte quickly leaving the club. His outspoken honesty to the media was heavily criticised at the time as Conte called out 'selfish players' and insisted the club's long-running lack of silverware was because of Tottenham's mentality. The Italian is currently out of work, but had been linked with a return to management in his home country, with Napoli and AC Milan both touted as potential new posts for the 54-year-old.","The Italian is currently out of work, but had been linked with a return to management in his home country, with Napoli and AC Milan both touted as potential new posts for the 54-year-old."

This isn't the first time the legandary former Manchester United boss has made clear what he thinks of the north Londoners. 15 years ago, Ferguson issued his famous 'Lads, it's Tottenham' team-talk to whip his own players into shape and remind them that they were the superior outfit. A decade-and-a-half later, it doesn't look like much has changed in terms of Ferguson's views on Spurs. He did make the claim while at Newbury Racecourse, just hours before Postecoglou's side enjoyed a dramatic last-gasp home win over Brighton to go fourth in the table. Brennan Johnson bagged a rare strike in the 96th minute to seal Spurs' comeback, after Pape Matar Sarr had bagged their equaliser following Pascal Gross' first-half penalty that put the Seagulls in front. The win only widens the gap between Spurs and Ferguson's beloved United, who are in action on Sunday afternoon. The Red Devils make the trip to Aston Villa aiming to keep their faint hopes of Champions League qualification alive. Though United are nine points adrift off fourth-placed Spurs, Ferguson still believes Postecoglou and Co. are way off competing for the biggest honours. Pressed for comment on if he thinks Spurs will ever win the Premier League, Ferguson told Sky Sports: ""No!"", as he failed to hold back his laughter at the sheer thought of the idea that they could ever be champions. ""No, â61 was the last time they won it, well thatâs a long time. The opposition today with Liverpool and Manchester City being so powerful in the Premier League. Even for United now, weâre having to fight."" He was then asked if it was more likely that Spurs would win a league title before United win another one, to which he rather emphatically replied: ""No chance!"" Now led by Erik ten Hag, United have endured a difficult season so far having already lost nine of their 23 league games. They are a whopping 14 points behind local rivals and 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City, who sit second in the table. United's last title triumph came under Ferguson himself, when he guided the club to the 2012/13 crown before calling time on his illustrious career. The closest they have come since was in 2021, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took the club to second in the table, 12 points behind champions City.","United's last title triumph came under Ferguson himself, when he guided the club to the 2012/13 crown before calling time on his illustrious career.

Will Evans was part of the Newport side who hosted United in the FA Cup fourth round in January, scoring a goal in a valiant 4-2 defeat. He was blown away by the pace and skill of Dalot, one of United's less heralded players. Asked by Goalposts TV who impressed him in the game, he said: 'Dalot. There was a ball that came over my head and it was probably chest height, and I'm watching it the whole way, and I see him in front of me. 'And he just - in the air - back-heeled it back to the 'keeper. 'And I just thought: ""what? What chance have I got?"" 'And he's rapid, he is lightning quick. I wasn't surprised, like you said, you're not surprised by it, but he was crazy for me.' Evans also paid tribute to the kindness of Fernandes and general humility of United's players. He said: 'Obviously we've got a few Liverpool fans in our team as well, we're saying we can't wait to get into Antony or Bruno, and everyone came off the pitch saying the exact same about all of them. 'Saying they're actually the most genuine, well they're just normal blokes. 'Bruno, after I scored my goal, I was running back, and he tapped me on the back and said: ""Good finish mate.""   'His post-match interview about Bryn Morris' strike, he said: ""the lad scored a brilliant strike [unbelievable shot] just before half-time."" 'And you think: he didn't have to say that.' Newport's encounter with United at an expanded and packed-out Valley Parade was testament to the magic of the FA Cup. Despite Newport being mid-table in League Two, they went toe-to-toe with one of the biggest clubs in the world and were level until the 68th minute, when United pulled away with an Antony goal. It was a scary night for United, who threw away a two-goal advantage, but they weathered the storm and kept themselves in with a chance of silverware.","It was a scary night for United, who threw away a two-goal advantage, but they weathered the storm and kept themselves in with a chance of silverware."

The Dutchman guided the Red Devils to Europe's premier competition last season during his first-year at the club, but was helpless to stop United being embarrassingly eliminated at the group stage this season. A difficult first half of the current campaign has left United nine-points adrift of the top-four, with a trip to Villa Park on Sunday giving them a chance of closing the gap to the teams above. Finishing fifth in the Premier League could also be enough to qualify for the Champions League due to new rules but is dependant on circumstances. However, Ten Hag has explained should United fail to make it into next season's edition of the competition then they will have less 'financial power' to bring in new players.   The 13-time Premier League champions are already trying to balance Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations and failed to bring in any January reinforcements despite Ten Hag being dealt several injury blows this season. Speaking ahead of Sunday's clash with Aston Villa, Ten Hag said: 'It's very important to play Champions League, that is clear. 'We don't even have to discuss this. What exactly is the impact in this moment? I don't know. 'You have more financial power when you achieve the Champions League and that is our target, absolutely.'   Missing out on qualifying for the competition that United have won three times in their history would see them lose out on a bonus exceeding Â£100m that is on offer to competing sides. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's multi-billion investment in the club is likely to restock some of the recruitment kitty, but new cash must comply with FFP guidelines that United and other Premier League sides are bound by.

The veteran Argentine has been a constant for Manuel Pellegrini since he returned to the club from Fiorentina.  Pezzella is in his fifth campaign with Los Verdiblancos across nine seasons and two spells. The 32-year-old returned to Betis in 2021, is now part of their captaincy group and has 169 appearances for the club now. For manager Manuel Pellegrini, he has been a reliable soldier in recent years. While Marc Bartra was there when he came in, Pezzella is the only defender that has been consistently available for Betis since the Chilean took over. He is a starter once again this year, with Bartra, Sokratis Papasthotopoulos and Chadi Riad rotating alongside him â he will be 35 by the time his new deal expires.","For manager Manuel Pellegrini, he has been a reliable soldier in recent years.

In a wide-ranging special report ahead of next weekâs expected confirmation of the petrochemical billionaireâs 25 per cent stake in his boyhood club, Mail Sport can also reveal that an option to move away from Old Trafford has already been ditched. The group is leaning towards a rebuild on land at the side of Unitedâs iconic home, with the hope that the project will be done in five years or sooner. A 5 star hotel along with United-themed attraction are being considered as part of a huge redevelopment. A 90,000 ânew Old Traffordâ could feature also huge ânew Stretford Endâ. Tottenhamâs sublime new manor, along with its single-tier, 17,500-capacity âKopâ style stand behind a goal, may well be recreated on a larger scale as part of a 90,000, state-of-the-art venue.    Insiders say INEOS are wasting no time as they seek to transform the Premier League giants. It has already been reported that talks have taken place with local politicians with regards to government involvement, including mayor of Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. What can also be disclosed is that talks with the Football Association at some stage are likely over luring some England matches away from Wembley to what is hoped would become a Wembley of the North. The view is that such a redevelopment, which stretches from Old Trafford down to the water and links the area with MediaCity, would take around five years. While nothing is set in stone, a 5 star-hotel and facilities to cater for those who travel to United from across the planet, who currently have a megastore and modest museum to entertain them on non-matchdays, is also highly likely. INEOS have experience in finding funding for vast infrastructure projects and are currently in the process of building a new Â£5bn chemical plant in Antwerp, Belgium. Agreement over financing would need to be reached with majority owners the Glazers, who are understood to be happy to let INEOS take the lead.   Any debt would have to be serviced and repaid but would be a different prospect than the existing debt from the Glazersâ leveraged buyout as it would be going on a facility that would significantly increase the clubâs revenues. A straight cash payment in a football stadium is deemed highly unlikely by government insiders. They point to the fact that other public-funding backed stadia often have a variety of uses and are, or have been, multi-sport venues and or part of a bid for a major sporting event. Manchester Cityâs Etihad Stadium, for example, was the centrepiece of Manchesterâs successful bid for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Old Trafford was not selected as a venue for the UK and Irelandâs bid to host the 2028 European Championship finals.",Old Trafford was not selected as a venue for the UK and Irelandâs bid to host the 2028 European Championship finals.

PSG and Real Sociedad will go head-to-head in the Champions League round of 16 in whatâs considered to be one of the most unpredictable clashes. Although Luis Enriqueâs men are a talented roster of stars, the Spaniards have proved to be a very solid team this season, finishing in Group Dâs top position. As expected before the start of this campaign, the Parisians are the Ligue 1 leaders, although they looked shaky in the UCL group stage and made it to the knockout stages after Newcastle lost to AC Milan at home. Real Sociedad, meanwhile, are fighting for the European positions in Spain, but their best performances have come in the Champions League. They avoided defeat in the six games they played and overtook Inter Milan in the race for their sectionâs top spot. You can watch a live stream of the game on FuboTV (free trial available). The game between PSG and Real Sociedad will be played on Wednesday, February 14, at Parc des Princes, Paris, with kick off at 3 p.m. ET/ noon PT. The following channels will be broadcasting the game live in the US: CBS Sports Network, Paramount+, and ViX. You can watch a live stream of the game on FuboTV (free trial available). You can be sure not to miss a moment of the action by joining our live text commentary right here on AS USA. Build up begins around an hour before kick-off. The Parisians are the favorites to get an early advantage in the tie against the Spanish side, as they have a very talented squad led by Kylian Mbappe and Ousmane Dembele up front. However, Imanol Alguacilâs players seem not to be scared of playing against the best teams in Europe and they could be a problem in Paris.

718,"What footballers struggled to be 'teammates'? Man Utd, Bayern, Liverpool...",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/What-footballers-struggled-to-be-teammates-Man-Utd-Bayern-Liverpool.../3302599,17 hours ago,"QUESTION It's well known that Manchester United's Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole didn't see eye to eye. What other players struggled to be 'teammates'?  On the pitch, Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham formed a professional partnership, scoring at a rate of a goal every 85 minutes. Off the pitch, they wouldn't talk to each other. The problem stemmed from Cole's England debut against Uruguay in March 1995. Sheringham, a Spurs player at the time, was substituted for Cole by manager Terry Venables in the 71st minute. Cole offered his hand and Sheringham snubbed it, leaving him humiliated. Sheringham joined Manchester United in 1997 but the two men could not get on. Cole said: 'I would rather sit down and have a cuppa with Neil Ruddock, who broke my leg in two places in 1996, than with Teddy Sheringham.' Nevertheless, a decade after they had retired, the two men buried the hatchet after bumping into each other in a nightclub.   Bayern Munich players Lothar Matthaus and Stefan Effenberg disliked each other so much that Effenberg included a chapter in his autobiography entitled What Lothar Matthaus Knows About Football, consisting of a blank page. There was a burning animosity between Liverpool legends 'Iron' Tommy Smith and Emlyn 'Crazy Horse' Hughes, two of Liverpool's greatest captains. Smith's dislike for Hughes dated back to 1973 when, after a fallout with manager Bill Shankly, Smith was replaced by Hughes. After Shankly's unexpected retirement in 1974, Hughes - much to Smith's chagrin - was confirmed as the captain by his successor, Bob Paisley.  Paisley was aware of the situation: 'Some of Emlyn's teammates weren't that fond of him and one of them, Tommy Smith, absolutely hated him. Smithy and Hughes never spoke to each other.' In the England cricket dressing room, Kevin Pietersen would upset his teammates by badmouthing them to the opposition. Spin bowler Graeme Swann said: 'Me and Kev never liked each other anyway. We actually got on better professionally because we were honest with each other. I wanted a Kevin Pietersen who was scoring runs because he was simply one of the best in the world.'",We actually got on better professionally because we were honest with each other.

719,"Harry Maguire is Manchester United's 'spiritual leader', insists Ian Ladyman",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Harry-Maguire-is-Manchester-Uniteds-spiritual-leader-insists-Ian-Ladyman/3302177,1 day ago,"Ian Ladyman has described Harry Maguire as Manchester United's 'spiritual leader' and lumped praise on the defender for his resolve fighting his way back into Erik ten Hag's side on Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast.  The defender was stripped of the captain's armband by the Dutch manager over the summer with the club seemingly intent to move on the player they purchased in 2019. But amid a slew of squad injuries, Maguire was able to fight for a spot in the starting XI and has become a regular fixture under Ten Hag this season, distinguishing himself in United's backline during a difficult campaign. Briefly set back by injury in December, Maguire returned to action against West Ham at the start of the month before helping Man United snatch a 2-1 victory against rivals for Europe Aston Villa at Villa Park. Both Mail Sport's Football Editor Ladyman and his podcast co-host Chris Sutton were keen to stress not only how important Maguire has been for United this season, but how resilient the player has been forced to be against a backdrop of criticism for past performances.   Describing him as 'football's renaissance man', Ladyman added that if he 'ever needed a heart transplant', the former club captain's would be first on his list. 'That bloke, what he's been through football-wise, and the way he's come back - to the level that he's come back at - deserves all the praise in the world,' Ladyman said.  'Those two at the back, Maguire and (Andre) Onana, I thought really got United through (against Villa). 'And if they are, to surprise the world, and finish in the top four this season, they're gonna need a bit more of that.' Sutton added that his co-host had 'nailed' the description of the defender, before continuing: 'I can't remember a player who's taken as much of a kicking and he just keeps getting up, when he gets the opportunity into the team. 'He's so, so reliable. I think everybody thought his days were numbered at Manchester United. I did. And yet he keeps proving people wrong time and time again.' Ladyman was quick to add that Maguire had also been short on complaints under constant scrutiny. 'He's never ever moaned about it publicly,' he said. 'No idea what he said privately or what's gone through his head - I can imagine. 'But publicly, he's never moaned about it. 'I was at Hampden Park last autumn when he had that awful night, lampooned by Scottish fans, scores an own goal, comes out afterwards and stands there and talks about it. And it's not the first time he's done it after England duty. 'Answers the questions, talks about the difficulties he's faced, never ever moaned about it. I just think he has shown extraordinary resolve in the last year, two years. 'He's come back. He's proved a manager who wanted to sell him wrong.   'I know he doesn't wear that captain's armband anymore - Bruno Fernandes has got that. But a captain's armband is only a piece of cotton at the end of the day. And the spiritual leader of that football team, when he plays, when he's fit, is Harry Maguire, as far as I'm concerned.' When probed as to whether he though Maguire deserved to re-take the armband from the Portugal international, Ladyman rejected the idea, wondering if it had 'weighed him down a bit'. 'Maybe he was finding it too much when he was in poor form to be captain as well,' Ladyman added. 'Let the guy play, pick him every week while he's fit and let him play because at the moment he's Manchester United's best defender.'","'Let the guy play, pick him every week while he's fit and let him play because at the moment he's Manchester United's best defender.'"
720,Arsenal outcast Marquinhos is set to return to Brazil & join Fluminense on loan,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-outcast-Marquinhos-is-set-to-return-to-Brazil--join-Fluminense-on-loan/3300760,12 Feb,"Arsenal winger Marquinhos is finalising his loan move to Fluminense.  The 20-year old had a season loan to Nantes cut short last month after he expressed a desire to play for Brazil U23s at the Pre-Olympic tournament which finished on Sunday. Fluminense are paying a loan fee and could try to make the move permanent in the summer. Marquinhos joined the Gunners from Sao Paulo in the summer of 2022, signing a long-term contract. However, he struggled for gametime, playing just six times in the first half of the 2022-23 campaign before joining Norwich City on loan in January 2023.  In his spells at Carrow Road and with Nantes, the Brazilian scored once in 18 appearances. Arsenal are meanwhile monitoring Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams.

Then Kroos, Valverde, Camavingaâ¦â You look at the way Vinicius Junior ripped apart Girona in Saturdayâs La Liga title tussle and you actually believe him. This isnât just lip service. Itâs hard to look past the Brazilian when you catch him in that kind of mood. It took just five minutes for Vinicius to open the scoring, firmly putting Girona in their place by drifting inside and unleashing a fierce strike that two âkeepers couldnât have stopped. It was a goal reminiscent of Real Madridâs all-time greatest goalscorer at his very best, Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazil, having produced Ballon dâOr winning greats like Rivaldo, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, havenât had one since Kaka in 2017. Neymar â with podium finishes in 2015 and 2017 â has come as close as anyone in that time, but his move to PSG failed to deliver the individual recognition he craved. Mbappe and Erling Haaland are yet to win footballâs most prestigious individual accolade, but have been anointed to dominate the post Messi and Ronaldo era. But you look at Vinicius and you sense he might have a word to say about that. Heâd have Ancelottiâs vote, anyway. Having already won everything there is to win with Los Blancos, the best might still be yet to come from the 23-year-old. Heâs entering his prime years and looks ready to dominate. As his manager noted, this Madrid team is full of great players. Not least Jude Bellingham, who scored twice against Girona to take his tally to 20 goals for the campaign before Valentineâs Day. The 20-year-old now levels David Beckham as Madridâs all-time top-scoring Englishman, having reached that milestone in 126 fewer appearances. But the night belonged to Vinicius, and Bellinghamâs second goal was all about the Brazilian, who completely toyed with his compatriot Yan Couto to dart into the box and shoot at goal, the effort eventually rebounding into the path of his team-mate for a tap-in. That was arguably the finest moment of a perfect performance from Vinicius. The opener, two direct assists, and that. Outrageous. Itâs no wonder that poor Couto was in tears after the final whistle. It brought to mind Maicon against Gareth Bale or Nelson Semedo against Alphonso Davies. Just one footballer â at the very top level, no less â as being fundamentally, brutally exposed as not being able to cope with their opposite number. Vinicius went to comfort Couto after the final whistle. It was a warm embrace where the sentiment could be left unsaid; youâre not the first player Iâve done that to, sunshine (and you wonât be the last). The Manchester City academy graduate had been bested by Madridâs No.7 for all four goals. The gulf in quality between those two sides almost entirely can be distilled almost entirely to that individual battle, won so emphatically and so savagely by one man. Couto is no amateur. The 21-year-old has been a key player for Girona in their shock title challenge, with his performances rewarded by his first caps for Brazil â and reports from Spain that Madrid themselves are monitoring his progress. âIt was the best performance of the season. We did everything the coach asked of us. We pressed like we had to and then dropped deeper,â Vinicius said after the final whistle. âThatâs the difference. When this team is up for it, weâre very hard to beat. And this was top opposition today. We have to keep this up to win La Liga.â Madrid have now put seven goals, without reply, past their closest challengers and have opened up a nice and comfortable five-point lead at the summit. Everything is looking good for Madrid right now. Thereâs Endrick to come in the summer, and Mbappe appears increasingly likely to follow. Considering thatâs on top of Vinicius and they might just be a new dynasty on the horizon.","Everything is looking good for Madrid right now.

Yamal, who became the youngest scorer in the competitionâs history against the same opposition earlier this season, curled home his second goal of the game 10 minutes from time to deny the visitors their first away win of the campaign. The 16-year-old had opened the scoring in the first half, but Granada equalised through Ricard Sanchez just before the interval and Facundo Pellistri made it 2-1 on the hour mark before Robert Lewandowski levelled moments later. The Magic of Lamine Yamal  pic.twitter.com/by485R5EnG â FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) February 11, 2024 A third goal in the space of six minutes from Ignasi Miquel restored Granadaâs lead as they belied their lowly place in the table, only for Yamal to have the last word with a brilliant solo effort. Yamal had come close to setting up Lewandowski for the opening goal before breaking the deadlock himself seconds later, volleying home at the far post from Joao Canceloâs cross. Myrto Uzuni attempted to get Granada back on level terms in spectacular fashion but failed to make contact with an overhead kick after 18 minutes, while Oscar Melendoâs follow-up shot blocked. The home side looked certain to regain their lead shortly before the interval when Ilkay Gundogan squared for Lewandowski with the goal seemingly at his mercy, but the 35-year-oldâs shot was brilliantly cleared off the line by Martin Hongla. Lamine Yamal  And Granada made the most of that reprieve in the 43rd minute when Pellistri drove to the byline before pulling the ball back for Sanchez to drill a first-time finish past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Barcelona coach Xavi had used his pre-match press conference to herald the âgreat newsâ that Ter Stegen was fit to play for the first time since November following back surgery, but the Germany international will be disappointed to have been beaten at his near post.

Despite Leipzig having an early goal disallowed, they had several promising opportunities to score but were repeatedly thwarted by the outstanding Andriy Lunin in the Madrid goal. Leipzig initially thought they had scored within the first two minutes when Benjamin Sesko headed home from a corner, but the goal was swiftly ruled out after a VAR review, seemingly due to a foul on Lunin.

The former Real Madrid forward was the Saudi Pro League side's marquee signing last summer, joining from the Spanish giants on a free transfer and signing a three-year deal. The Frenchman has performed well on the pitch - scoring 15 times from 24 games in all competition - but problems have emerged off the pitch after a row that began after the player returned late from training last month. Benzema was said to have been excluded from training after returning from his holiday 17 days late last month, which left his new employers incensed after telling the striker to report back for duty on January 2. A source said they couldn't even establish contact with him for 10 days as he holidayed in Mauritius, although he was reportedly stuck there initially due to a cyclone. That meant that Benzema did not travel with his team-mates to their mid-season training camp in Dubai, with the fallout seeing Benzema ask to temporarily leave the club as he was linked with the likes of Manchester United.  And having also been dropped from their Saudi Pro League game against Al-Tai last week, Benzema has now been handed another blow after boss Marcelo Gallardo failed to name him in the squad for their Asian Champions League trip to Navbahor Namangan in Uzbekistan, according to Spanish outlet AS. Al-Ittihad have a limit of five non-Asian players they can name in a Champions League squad, with Gallardo opting for defender Ahmed Hegazy former Premier League midfielders N'Golo Kante and Fabinho and forward Romarinho and Abderrazak Hamdallah. The report claims that Benzema lacks match sharpness after being left out of the mid-season training camp and instead trained alone in Saudi Arabia while his team-mates jetted off. It comes after reports Benzema - who has not played since a 5-2 loss to Al-Nassr on Boxing Day - stormed out of a team session after refusing to follow Gallardo's instructions - before being dropped for the Al-Tai clash. Benzema had crunch talks with the club's hierarchy at the start of February and was touted to leave in January due to being unsettled - with former club Lyon among the clubs charged with interest - but he stayed put.  But despite the doubt over his future and huge speculation he could leave, Benzema has insisted he enjoys the 'challenge' of playing for Al-Ittihad and that he was commited to their project. Speaking to GQ Middle East, Benzema said: 'It [being in Saudi] is a new challenge [and one] that I like â a long-term project and in a Muslim country. 'I'm not only a football player here in Saudi Arabia, I'm also an ambassador. I'm here to bring great European players in, in the near future, even if there are already great ones in the Saudi league. Our challenge is to raise it to the same level of the European Leagues. 'Time will tell [what happens next] but it will be myself who chooses when my career will end or not. 'Ultimately, I would like to be remembered as someone who started from the bottom and worked their way up to the top alone, and despite all the obstacles I have faced. That is something that makes me truly proud.'","'Ultimately, I would like to be remembered as someone who started from the bottom and worked their way up to the top alone, and despite all the obstacles I have faced.

725,"Copenhagen vs Man City prediction, lineups, odds and betting tips",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Copenhagen-vs-Man-City-prediction-lineups-odds-and-betting-tips/3300924,13 Feb,"The first knockout round in the Champions League has thrown up what many would consider a favourable tie for reigning champions Man City (9/4 favourites to win this yearâs competition).  However, FC Copenhagen shouldnât be written off given that they eliminated the other Manchester club in the group stage. When United visited the Danish capital, they were on the wrong side of a seven-goal thriller that was won by teenager Roony Bardghji at the death. This first leg in this Round of 16 clash will take place at Telia Parken too as Pep Guardiolaâs side look to do what their bitter rivals couldnât. City scored 18 goals across their six Group Stage wins, conceding seven at the other end. The return of clinical finisher Erling Haaland comes at the least opportune moment for Copenhagen. As if last yearâs treble winnersâ 10-game win streak in all competitions wasnât enough, the Norwegian forward is back amongst the squad and back amongst the goals, scoring twice in the weekend win over Everton. Man City arenât naÃ¯ve enough to undermine an opponent whether it be domestically or on the continent, and Guardiola very rarely puts out an undercooked XI. With this in mind, anything but a win for the English champions away from home would come as quite the shock, particularly with the focal point that is Haaland back from the treatment room. Copenhagen clearly have some dangerous players, and a familiar face or two as well, most notably former Celtic and Southampton winger Mohamed Elyounoussi. Haalandâs fellow countryman also scored a brace on the weekend and so he is someone that will need to be on Cityâs radar, not to mention that he was also on the score sheet in the aforementioned 4-3 win over Erik ten Hagâs United side. How are both teams expected to line up on Tuesday night? Here are the predicted lineups from WhoScored.com with all the relevant team news. Grabara; Ankersen, Vavro, Diks, Jelert; Bardghji, Falk, Goncalves; Elyounoussi, Claesson, Achouri Ederson; Ake, Dias, Stones, Walker; Lewis, Rodri; Foden, De Bruyne, Doku; Haaland Man Cityâs recent dominance is reflected in the odds for this game, with bet365 amongst those to be offering 1/4 for the likely outcome. Meanwhile, BetUK have a Copenhagen win priced up at 13/1 and a draw can be found at 11/2 on Paddy Power. Erling Haaland scored twice against Everton on his return to the team, and Sky Bet are offering odds of 7/2 for him to repeat this feat in the Champions League. He is no stranger to scoring multiple goals in a game, having done so on four out of five occasions on a particularly prosperous stretch across October and November. In this period, Chelsea and Manchester United were amongst those on the receiving end of his wrath as well as two UCL opponents as well. In all three of their Champions League group stage outings away from home, Pep Guardiolaâs men scored three goals. Odds of 23/20 with 888sport for them to match this or even better it are massively worthwhile, and if youâre feeling brave, you could further stretch it to over 3.5 (7/2 on Betfair). Not only do City have a strong record of scoring 3+ goals on their travels, but they have also done exactly this in their last three Premier League games away from the Etihad too.

After their 1-0 win over RB Leipzig on Tuesday, footage was captured of pair discussing his positional change with opponent and compatriot Mohamed Simakan.  Camavinga should know. Last season he filled in on occasion at left-back, following Didier Deschamps decision to use him there for France at the 2022 World Cup, and performed so well there that he ended up becoming one of Ancelottiâs go-to options during 2023. Amid fitness issues for Ferland Mendy, he started arguably Real Madridâs most crucial games of the season against Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals there. Now with David Alaba out until the end of the season, Eder Militao still at least a month away as he recovers from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and Antonio Rudiger also injured, Tchouameni has been dropped back to defence. Certainly his strong performances there threaten to make him a viable option â regardless of Camavingaâs jokes. So far in the five matches that Tchouameni has played there this season, Los Blancos are yet to concede.","Now with David Alaba out until the end of the season, Eder Militao still at least a month away as he recovers from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and Antonio Rudiger also injured, Tchouameni has been dropped back to defence.

Mbappe remains as Los Blancos main target in 2024 as part of a long running pursuit of the France captain. Real Madrid were infamously rejected by Mbappe in 2022, as he opted to sign a contract extension in Paris, but the situation has now changed. Mbappe looks certain to decline the chance to activate a 12 month extension in Paris with Ral Madrid already tabling an offer. He is able to join a free transfer at the end of the campaign in what would be a major power play from Real Madrid. Despite the huge increase in competition for places, if Mbappe does complete a move to Madrid, his potential attacking partner Rodrygo Goes is excited by the link up. âIf Kylian Mbappe comes, he will help us. He is one of the best in the world. I want to play with the best players of course, but I canât say more on this topicâ, he said.

728,Man United handed ANOTHER blow as Luke Shaw is forced off at HT against Villa,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-United-handed-ANOTHER-blow-as-Luke-Shaw-is-forced-off-at-HT-against-Villa/3300735,12 Feb,"Luke Shaw's withdrawal at half-time in the win at Aston Villa was a 'precautionary' move, revealed boss Erik ten Hag.  There was concern for the England full-back given he has had numerous issues with injury in recent seasons. United fans quickly became concerned that their first choice left back is facing another spell on the sidelines, but Ten Hag was quick to allay fears in his post-match press conference following a 2-1 win at Villa. 'Precaution,' Ten Hag told Sky Sports. 'He had some complaints and we can't take any risks with him because he's had any injuries in the past.  'We'll have to see how it goes in the next few days. It's not an advantage to lose him, everyone knows my philosophy to have left-footers at left centre back and left back. We have to make compromises and it is not to our advantage.' Victor Lindelof, a centre back tasked to cover at left back, came on to replace him, with United looking to hold on to a 1-0 lead after Rasmus Hojlund's first half strike. United have made strides forward in recent weeks but injuries now look to be creeping back in just as Ten Hag's side build up some momentum. News of Shaw's half-time withdrawal comes just a week on from Lisandro Martinez damaging the medial ligament in his right knee against West Ham.  The Argentine centre back, who plays so well alongside Shaw, buckled under a challenge from Vladimir Coufal in the second half of United's 3-0 win at Old Trafford. Martinez initially played on after treatment but only lasted another couple of minutes before he signalled to the bench to be taken off. United confirmed last Monday that he will be out of action for at least eight weeks, although he will not require surgery. Ten Hag's side struggled once Shaw went off, with Villa equalising through Douglas Luiz early in the second half, before substitute Scott McTominay scored a late win to rescue three points for United.","Ten Hag's side struggled once Shaw went off, with Villa equalising through Douglas Luiz early in the second half, before substitute Scott McTominay scored a late win to rescue three points for United."
729,Fans poke fun at Neymar after photo appears to show him out of shape,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Fans-poke-fun-at-Neymar-after-photo-appears-to-show-him-out-of-shape/3302814,8 hours ago,"Neymar has made his first appearance on the training ground since his ACL injury but concerned fans by appearing to not be in the best physical shape - thanks to an unflattering angle of the Brazilian.  The Al-Hilal star has been out of action since October, after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament against Uruguay while on international duty. Pictures emerged earlier this week showing the 32-year-old back in the gym and on his road to recovery, and a video was posted showing his first steps back on the training pitch. However, a still from that video has spilt fans as angle of the snap appears to show the forward being out of shape following months on the sidelines. Fans were quick to take to social media to question and mock the striker, with one suggesting 'Neymar doesn't look fit', and another stating 'Retirement is calling'.   Others online compared Neymar's shape to that of fellow Brazilian Ronaldo, who suffered criticisms over his weight during his playing days, by calling him 'RONALDO 2.0'. While there were also claims of 'Neymar doesnât care about competitive football anymore lol' and another who slammed his decision to move to Saudi by stating;' Neymar leaving Barcelona has to be the worst decision a player has ever taken in football history. It's been a downward path since then. Now, he has added weight. Really sad!' Yet, some on social media have come to the defence of Neymar, claiming the image is just an unfortunate angle, and to cut the striker some slack. 'It's not real, Neymar didn't gain weight'. One post insisted, while others backed it up with the caption 'fake' and used the images of him in the gym as evidence to suggest there was nothing wrong with his fitness.      Neymar moved to the Saudi Pro League club in August last year, after six seasons with Paris Saint-Germain in a Â£78million deal. The two-year contract is said to be worth around Â£130million, making him one of the most expensive purchases in the Saudi League. He mad his debut in as a substitute in the 6-1 thrashing of Al-Riyadh in September, coming off the bench to assist one of the goals, before scoring his first goal for the club in the AFC Champions Cup win over F.C. Nassaji Mazandaran. However, the injury suffered whilst playing for Brazil has seen Neymar played just five games in total since the summer move. Al-Hilal were forced deregister the Brazilian as a result of the season-ending injury so the could free up one of their eight foreign roster spots for the arrival of Renan Lodi in January.     The club will be able to re-register Neymar at the end of the season when he is likely to return from injury, but will need to reassess his role in the team. They already have a number of high-profile foreign names on their books including Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic, so Neymar must prove he has a place in the squad ahead of next season. His current deal with the club expires in June 2025, with the option of to extend for a further year, but has already been linked with a return to old club Santos when his experience in the Middle East is complete.","His current deal with the club expires in June 2025, with the option of to extend for a further year, but has already been linked with a return to old club Santos when his experience in the Middle East is complete."

Napoli stand in their way of their path to the quarter-finals for the first time since Lionel Messi left, but the Blaugrana are still nursing a number of fitness problems going into that tie.  In addition to the loss of Gavi and Alejandro Balde for the rest of the season, Joao Felix and Ferran Torres looking ulikely to make, Marcos Alonso is also more likely to miss the game against the Italian champions. Marca say that that Barcelona do not want to run unnecessary risks with Alonso. He went down with a similar back injury to Marc-Andre ter Stegen, and also underwent surgery in December. He is expected back at the end of the month. As such he is more likely to return against Getafe or Athletic Club the following week. Alonsoâs recovery is thought to be going well, but he will be one of their only options at the position down the stretch for Barcelona, after Baldeâs injury. Joao Cancelo is the only other obvious choice to play there, although teenager Hector Fort has also filled in there at times.","As such he is more likely to return against Getafe or Athletic Club the following week.

731,The son of a Real Madrid legend enrolled onto Messi & Busquets apprenticeship,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/The-son-of-a-Real-Madrid-legend-enrolled-onto-Messi--Busquets-apprenticeship/3301795,2 days ago,"The task of carrying an iconic surname often proves too much for plenty of stars, but that pressure ramps up tenfold when youâre continuing the legacy of a Real Madrid legend.  Fernando Redondo might not be remembered as one of footballâs sexiest players on the pitch, but he was undoubtedly one of the best from his era. A defensive midfielder which most clubs would hurl themselves towards bankruptcy for these days, Redondo won two Champions League titles with Real and two La Liga titles, before adding another Champions League to his already stacked trophy cabinet with Milan. Simply put, the Argentine was different gravy. Completely. If Redondo was gravy and the Argentines appreciated it as much as us Brits do, heâd be on every meal they ever eat and there would be a prayer in his honour before every single one. He was just that good. Not always the sexiest, but always that important. Itâs exactly that legacy which is what makes it incredibly hard for 21-year-old Federico Redondo to follow up his father in any way, but heâs made a promising start to his career so far and the signs are positive. Born in Madrid, but representing Argentina through his family, young Federico signed with Argentinos Juniors aged 10 and has honed his craft at the base of midfield â like his father â virtually ever since, signing professional terms in 2021 and representing La Albiceleste at youth level. A call-up to the pre-Olympics Argentina squad for 2024 has been the latest triumph to date in the 21-year-oldâs blossoming career, but things might just be about to get a whole lot better. Redondo is set to join MLS outfit Inter Miami, which doesnât sound like much on the surface, but for a young baller looking to add minutes to their CV and hone their craft around senior pros, itâs the perfect next step. It also means heâll be sharing the pitch with Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suarez â the first two being particularly crucial. Considering heâs somewhat of a Busquets regen with potential through the roof, the chance to learn on the job alongside one of the gameâs greatest holding midfielders is invaluable â even if it means heâs gone behind enemy lines to rub shoulders with Barcelona icons. One look at his performances for Argentina in the Olympics qualifiers is testament to that frightening potential and the fact that heâs more than capable of living up to the Busquets comparisons and â crucially â the family name, with the right guidance. Redondo by name, Busquets by nature. The lad has a blend of both in the way he struts around the field with a sickening nonchalance, nipping the ball away from attackers and popping his way out of pressure situations with ease. At just 21, heâs got a press resistance that ought to make Busquets stand to attention when he heads to Miami and pulls on that pink jersey for the first time. A move to Inter Miami at the very beginning of his career, when thereâs been interest from some of Europeâs biggest clubs, sounds like insanity, but itâs quietly a stroke of genius from young Redondo, who is clearly already two steps ahead like his father was on the pitch. Not only will he realise the dream of every young Argentine ever in playing alongside and learning from the immortal Messi, but heâll undertake the perfect apprenticeship with Busquets ahead of him, priming him for that inevitable big-time move to Europe should he fulfil his potential. Itâs an incredibly exciting move. If the Barcelona reunion wasnât reason enough to tune into Inter Miami games, then their capture of Redondo most certainly is.

As part of the renewal agreement, his release clause stayed at a meagre â¬50m, which is sure to tempt many clubs during the transfer window.  The Premier League looks to be a likely destination for Williams. Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal have all been credited with an interest in the 21-year-old over the last few months, and in the case of The Gunners, they are still interested. As Fabrizio Romano has told Caught Offside in his exclusive column, Arsenal have scouted Williams in recent weeks, and the same can be said for Chelsea, who are also eyeing up a possible summer move. âArsenal have also sent their scouts to follow Nico Williams of Athletic Club multiple times, and itâs the same for Chelsea as they included him in the list last summer. The race is completely open, and nothing is advanced with either club so far. Heâd be great in the Premier League in my opinion â a physical and technical player; very good one.â Athletic Club could well be resigned to losing Williams in the summer, although they would earn a significant pay day if he does go. However, heâs going nowhere for now, and he will be a huge player for Ernesto Valverdeâs side between now and the end of the season.","Athletic Club could well be resigned to losing Williams in the summer, although they would earn a significant pay day if he does go.

735,Boehly singled out Sterling in dressing room rant after Blues defeat last season,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Boehly-singled-out-Sterling-in-dressing-room-rant-after-Blues-defeat-last-season/3302822,7 hours ago,"Chelsea owner Todd Boehly reportedly singled out Raheem Sterling for a dressing room dressing down after the Blues' 2-1 defeat at home to Brighton last April.  The Seagulls came from behind to win at Stamford Bridge towards the end of a miserable campaign for Chelsea that saw them finish 12th in the league, and Boehly headed to see the players after the final whistle. According to The Telegraph, Boehly gave Sterling a personal pep talk first rather than speaking to the whole squad. The American reminded Sterling that he is a world-class player - having won four league titles at Manchester City - but demanded more from him in terms of performance and leadership. Sterling was closest to the dressing room door, which may explain why he was spoken to first, but it also could have been interpreted as a major statement from Boehly as the England winger was his first major signing in July 2022.  Sterling is understood to have taken the criticism well, with Boehly then turning his attention to the rest of the group. Speaking to the squad, Boehly lashed out in the dressing room rant, calling their performances across the course of the campaign 'embarrassing'. It was not the first time he had addressed the players after a game as this was a regular occurrence during his first season at the helm. Interim boss Frank Lampard claimed at the time that he had no problem with Boehly taking centre stage in the dressing room, insisting it just showed his passion for the club. Boehly's emotional speech was intended to be a rallying cry, but Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid just three days later, and they won just one of their final seven league games after the Brighton loss. Sterling scored twice the following month in a 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest, and started this season strongly as he looked to earn an England recall. However, his performances have dipped in recent weeks and he was jeered off by his own fans when he was substituted during a 4-2 home loss against Wolves earlier this month. The 29-year-old has not started for the Blues since, and has been restricted to cameo appearances of the bench in Chelsea's last two games against Aston Villa and Crystal Palace.","The 29-year-old has not started for the Blues since, and has been restricted to cameo appearances of the bench in Chelsea's last two games against Aston Villa and Crystal Palace."
736,Chelsea boss Emma Hayes reveals how her son made her decision to take USA job,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-boss-Emma-Hayes-reveals-how-her-son-made-her-decision-to-take-USA-job/3302604,18 hours ago,"Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said she decided to take the USWNT managerâs role only after receiving âendorsementâ from her five-and-a-half-year old son Harry.  The long-time Blues boss called an end on her more than 11-year tenure with the club earlier this season to become the new head coach of the four-time world champions. The Hayes era at Chelsea has been defined by unprecedented and sustained domestic success at the club, with the 47-year-old claiming 13 major trophies, including six Womenâs Super League titles. And Hayes has revealed that when she was tucking her son into bed earlier this year, she presented him with the opportunity to swap London for the USA. âI asked him, âMummyâs got the chance to go and coach the USA team or we can stay here?â and his reaction really helped me,â Hayes told the Telegraph. âI didnât know what he was going to say, but he smiled, he hugged me, he kissed me and he said, âLetâs go to the USA, Mummy, Iâm really excited, I want to go to the USA!â and I almost couldnât believe it. That was it, that was the endorsement I needed.â Since announcing her departure, Hayes has stressed the importance of family in her decision to leave west London, emphasising how she desired to pick Harry up from school and spend less hours travelling to and from work. The timing of the conversations with US Soccer over the vacancy following former manager Vlatko Adanovskiâs sacking after a torrid Womenâs World Cup showing also played a role as the approaches for the role arrived shortly after Hayesâ father, Sid, passed away at age 82. âTruthfully, I was grieving, and I couldnât think of anything else. I didnât have any feeling at that point,â Hayes said. âSo, I just felt like it was hard to make a life-changing decision, at a time that just didnât feel right, so reaching that decision with almost a compromise to start at the end of this season was, I think, the only way I could have done it.â News of Hayesâ departure was equally shocking and foreseeable, as Hayes has spoken at length of the exacting demands of elite-level coaching. The Chelsea manager revealed her plans to leave to an emotional dressing room following their 6-0 win over Aston Villa last November. âIt was a silent dressing room. It was very reflective,â said Hayes. âThere was shock. But for me, too, it wasnât just them. The players were happy for me, because they knew how much Harry meant, and how much Iâve sacrificed. And at the same time it was sad, because change was coming and that familiarity was about to end. âBut that feeling passed. The team have adapted, and theyâre all excited for their future with a new coach. Itâs important to keep mentioning that. Theyâve had one voice for 11 years, not all of them, but itâs time, too, for them to have a different type of leader and a different type of learning, and vice-versa for me.â Since Hayesâ announcement, Chelsea have lost only one game in and are still fighting on all four fronts, including the Womenâs Champions League which is the one trophy which has eluded Hayes in her splendid tenure.","Since Hayesâ announcement, Chelsea have lost only one game in and are still fighting on all four fronts, including the Womenâs Champions League which is the one trophy which has eluded Hayes in her splendid tenure."
737,Man Utd's Antony is backed to succeed by the player he replaced at Old Trafford,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-Utds-Antony-is-backed-to-succeed-by-the-player-he-replaced-at-Old-Trafford/3302160,1 day ago,"Antony has been backed to eventually come good at Manchester United due - in part - to his 'great' ability and 'beautiful' personality by Anthony Elanga.  The Nottingham Forest winger saw his game time at Old Trafford limited before being shipped out of the club last season following the Brazilian's arrival. Antony endured a lacklustre maiden campaign before sinking to even greater depths this term, providing just two goal contributions that both came during an FA Cup win against League Two Newport County. Despite his former Ajax manager Erik ten Hag shelling out Â£86million to bring him to Manchester in 2022, it appears even the Dutchman has lost faith in the tricky winger, now opting to deploy Alejandro Garnacho in his place on the right. However, that has not altered Elanga's perspective on his former team-mate, who he believes will someday succeed for the Red Devils.  'Antony is a great player and a beautiful person.' The Swedish forward told SoccerNews.nl. 'We had a lot of contact when I was at United, and we still talk sometimes now. âI am confident that he will score a lot of goals there. I could already see that during the training sessions. âI believe in God, and he told me to go to Nottingham, and Antony is still at United. But he will really be successful there.â Elanga's divinely-inspired decision to move to the east Midlands has borne fruit, with the 21-year-old establishing himself as a key player in Nuno Espirito Santo's squad. In the Premier League, he has five goals and six assists from 23 appearances for a side battling to avoid to the drop.  Elanga also opened up on his decision to leave United and insisted that he holds no ill feeling toward Ten Hag amid reports at the time that the manager forced him out of the club. âWas Ten Hag the reason I left United? No, I wouldnât say that.' He added. 'I just wanted to play, that was especially important to me. 'Iâm young and I donât want to sit on the bench all season, you know?

738,10 THINGS WE LEARNED in Serie A this weekend...,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/10-THINGS-WE-LEARNED-in-Serie-A-this-weekend.../3301348,14 Feb,"Another weekend of Serie A action has flown by, and it was a very satisfactory one for Inter Milan as they came from behind to beat Roma 4-2 at the Stadio Olimpico.  That result extended their lead at the top of the table to seven points as Juventus suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat against Udinese. Meanwhile, AC Milan closed to within a point of Massimiliano Allegri's men with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Napoli, and there were emphatic victories for Atalanta, Bologna and Fiorentina as they chase down a Champions League spot. At the other end of the table, Salernitana lost 3-1 to Empoli and opted to sack Filippo Inzaghi, replacing him with the experienced Fabio Liverani. Mail Sport's Alvise Cagnazzo picks out 10 things we learned from a fascinating weekend in Italy. Marcus Thuram is probably Serie A's best signing of the season, as well as Manchester United's biggest regret. He arrived at Inter from Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach and is now the most decisive attacker in the Nerazzurri front line thanks to striking up a blossoming partnership with Lautaro Martinez. He has scored nine goals - the same as Hakan Calhanoglu - and registered seven assists, exceptional numbers for someone who is experiencing his first year at Inter and in Italy, a much more difficult and tactical championship than the Bundesliga. Unlike United's Antony, he is a fundamental player even when he doesn't score goals, participating in all the team's offensive actions. Against Roma, after a first-half full of problems, he became the protagonist in the second half, troubling the Giallorossi defense with vertical runs and sudden changes of pace. His goal demonstrated expert precision, reminiscent of a peak Filippo Inzaghi, and he played a crucial role in defender Angelino's own goal which condemned Roma to defeat. The feeling is that Marcus could have a better career than his highly-decorated father, Lilian, who won the World Cup in 1998 with France, but only time will reveal whether he can surpass Thuram Snr.   Ciro Immobile made Serie A history by scoring the 200th goal of his career in the Italian championship in Lazio's 3-1 win over Cagliari. His last goal from open play was back in August against Lecce, highlighting the issues he has had in front of goal lately. But he finally got his 200th goal this weekend and he now sits alongside legends such as Stano Piola, Francesco Totti, Gunnar Nordahl, Giuseppe Meazza, Jose Altafini, Antonio Di Natale and Roberto Baggio. The victory against Cagliari and the strong performance of the No 17 confirms how Immobile is still a fundamental man for Maurizio Sarri's team. His next goal will be to reach that seventh place occupied by Baggio, who scored 205 goals in Serie A. His 200 goals in 341 games in Serie A is a fine record, with his first and 200th both coming against Cagliari. He is a charismatic captain and sows panic in the opposing defense with his mere presence in the penalty box. Immobile is not the same player as 12 months ago but he is still a threat that allows Sarri to play with an effective 4-3-3 system.  Theo Hernandez's 28th goal for Milan was a masterpiece and proved to be the difference in his side's narrow win against Napoli. In the big match on Sunday evening, Olivier Giroud and Rafael Leao combined to confuse Napoli's back line, with Walter Mazzarri's side still yet to get to grips with transitioning from a back four to a three-man defence. This allowed Hernandez to race through a gaping hole and he finished with the class of a centre-forward. The French full-back knows how to do everything and does it very well, carrying out Stefano Pioli's tactical instructions perfectly. He neutralised dangerous winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia after losing him in the opening minutes of the game, and combined effectively with Leao down the left flank. Davide Calabria's exit due to injury led to Hernandez taking the armband, and he proceeded to lead his team to an important win. He is a player who deserves to be a protagonist in a top English club that is playing to win the Champions League, but seems content with living the best phase of his career at Milan. The love for the club that trusted him when Real Madrid decided to turn their back is immense, and the feeling is that Hernandez could decide to remain a key player for the Rossoneri in Serie A forever.  Zero shots on target in the first 45 minutes and a goal conceded on the counter-attack meant Napoli slumped to another loss against Milan. They have collected just one point in their last five games, and they haven't scored away from home since November, a run stretching over 460 minutes. Napoli have been deprived of their talisman Victor Osimhen over the past month as he made it to the Africa Cup of Nations final with Nigeria, but their statistics against Milan still make for embarrassing reading. January signings Cyril Ngonge and Leander Dendoncker have also failed to make a positive impact, and manager Walter Mazzarri deserves some sympathy for having limited resources to work with. The defeat at the San Siro, Napoli's eighth of the season, worsens their position in the standings and clarifies the tactical and technical limits of the defending champions. In the second half, Napoli improved and had 60 per cent possession, but could not break down Milan's stubborn defence. Napoli have consistently lost against the top sides on the road this season, and if their away form doesn't improve they may miss out on European football altogether.  Charles De Ketelaere and Teun Koopmeiners are two Flemish playmakers that are making Atalanta one of the most watchable teams in Europe. The pair demolished Genoa, showing extraordinary technical and physical superiority as Gian Piero Gasperini's men cruised to a 4-1 win. If Atalanta decided to sell both of them, they could earn around â¬100m (Â£85m). In their respective roles, they are the best in Serie A and are constantly making valuable contributions on the pitch. Belgium's De Ketelaere has six goals and six assists in 21 appearances this term, while Dutch midfielder Koopmeiners has nine direct goal involvements to his name in 20 outings. Juventus have already registered interest in signing Koopmeiners, and it is little surprise given the performances he has produced in recent months. In the match against Genoa, De Ketelaere and Koopmeiners dismantled Alberto Gilardino's side with their quality and intensity, crushing their opponents in their own half. While the agreement with Milan for the permanent purchase of De Ketelaere will be formalised in the next few weeks, staying in Bergamo is now considered impossible for Koopmeiners. His goal on the weekend was a thing of beauty, as he curled a free-kick into the corner of the net. De Ketelaere scored a stunner of his own, firing a left-foot volley home, as he silenced the home crowd with one of the best goals of the season.   The arrival of Daniele De Rossi on the Roma bench has allowed Stephan El Shaarawy to blossom again. His goal against Inter demonstrated his physical and technical abilities, and offered a reminder of why he should be considered one of the best players in Serie A. As the minutes passed, Inter dominated and the Roma winger, after a brilliant start, collapsed physically and psychologically. But El Sharaawy has grown immeasurably since Jose Mourinho's departure and is now an irreplaceable player for Roma. He has moved ahead of Nicola Zalewski in the pecking order, and unlike the young Polish full-back, El Shaarawy carries out the task of balancing the defensive phase while also providing a threat going forwards. In the second half of Saturday's match, Roma were on the back foot, but El Shaarawy stood up and is now one of the leaders in the side alongside defender Gianluca Mancini. El Shaarawy has won over the Roma fans and the unconditional trust of Daniele De Rossi. He is no longer a selfish player, but one that is willing to put the team ahead of everything else.  In his first match as a starter, Andrea Belotti scored his first goal for Fiorentina in their 5-1 demolition of Frosinone. The former Torino striker experienced one of the most difficult moments of his career at Roma, becoming reserve for Tammy Abraham and then Romelu Lukaku without ever managing to become the starting centre-forward. He was a peripheral figure in the squad, but now looks to have a new lease of life in a Fiorentina team that suits his attributes perfectly. Against Frosinone, Belotti looked back to somewhere near his best with his sharp movement causing problems, and he took his goal well to set Fiorentina on their way to a resounding win. It seems leaving Roma was the best choice for his career, and he has already become a fundamental presence for Fiorentina and coach Vincenzo Italiano. He received a warm ovation from the fans when he was substituted in the second half, and could have a big role to play as Fiorentina hunt down a top-four finish.  Salernitana made the serious mistake of thinking they could repeat their miraculous climb to safety from two years ago with the purchase of international level players who have reached the end of their careers. Unfortunately in modern football, it is difficult to pick up results when relying on faded stars who had the best years of their careers a decade ago. Jerome Boateng and Kostas Manolas flourished at Bayern Munich and Roma respectively, but have been worn down by too many injuries and now have obvious limitations. Guillermo Ochoa and Antonio Candreva are also well over 30 years of age. Sporting director Walter Sabatini has built an old, poorly assembled and above all poorly managed team. Filippo Inzaghi was given his marching orders after Friday's 3-1 home loss against Empoli, and he has consistently failed in Serie A after previous miserable spells at Milan and Bologna. But his successor, Fabio Liverani, will have a tough task keeping Salernitana up, with the team rock-bottom and seven points from safety.  Sooner or later Luciano Spalletti will have to explain why there are goalkeepers with fantastic performances in Serie A who cannot take away Gianluigi Donnarumma's place as the No 1 of the Italian national team. Lazio's Ivan Provedel played one of the best matches of his career against Cagliari, keeping out shots from Gianluca Lapadula, Antoine Makoumbou, Gabriele Zappa, Gianluca Gaetano to help his side take home all three points. At 29-years-old, Provedel is experiencing the best moment of his career, and has been one of the standout shot-stoppers in Italy's top flight. Claudio Lotito's club are negotiating the goalkeeper's contract and the agreement for an extension until 2028 is increasingly closer.  Davide Nicola's Empoli have taken eight points in four games, and now look capable of staying up after looking doomed to relegation just a few weeks ago. The 3-1 win against Salernitana was another step in the right direction, and Empoli have now jumped to 16th place, two points above the bottom three. The excellent start to 2024 has boosted the players' morale and the choice to buy M'Baye Niang, strongly supported by the coach, was immediately rewarded.  His decisive late penalty on Friday handed Empoli a vital three points, and the team are now playing without the fear that affected them in the opening months of the season before Nicola's arrival. Nicola has previously led Crotone and Salernitana to safety when the odds were stacked against them, and he looms ready to do the same at Empoli over the coming months.","Nicola has previously led Crotone and Salernitana to safety when the odds were stacked against them, and he looms ready to do the same at Empoli over the coming months."
739,Eddie Howe admits concerns as Manchester United line up Dan Ashworth move,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Eddie-Howe-admits-concerns-as-Manchester-United-line-up-Dan-Ashworth-move/3302825,7 hours ago,"Eddie Howe is confident Newcastle will protect themselves to prevent sporting director Dan Ashworth from taking inside knowledge with him to Manchester United. The PA news agency understands United want the former Football Association technical director to oversee a new era at Old Trafford in the wake of Sir Jim Ratcliffeâs arrival as co-owner. Ashworth was recruited by Newcastleâs new owners from Brighton to perform a similar role 20 months ago, and his loss would represent a significant blow to their project on Tyneside and to their hopes of competing with a direct rival for the trophies and Champions League football they crave. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe wants Dan Ashworth  Asked if the detailed intelligence the 52-year-old possesses about his current employers and their blueprint was a concern, head coach Howe replied: âI think your concerns are relevant. I donât know quite how much I can say on that, but I share your feelings.â He added: âIt goes without saying that weâre very protective of whatâs ours, whether thatâs players or staff. If people do eventually move on to other clubs, thereâs a process to go through before that is reality.â Howe insisted there had, as of Friday morning, been no formal contact between the clubs, but was candid when asked if Ashworth had told him he wanted to remain at St Jamesâ Park amid the whirl of speculation in recent days. He said simply: âNo.â Unitedâs interest in Ashworth, who is credited with establishing Englandâs DNA during his time with the FA, is long-standing and the Magpies have been aware of the situation for some time. They themselves prised him free from Brighton â he resigned from his role at the AMEX Stadium in February 2022, but did not take up his new post until June of the same year after lengthy negotiations which eventually resulted in a sizeable compensation payment. United would have to enter into a similar arrangement to secure his services sooner than the terms of his contract at Newcastle stipulate, but there is an acceptance on Tyneside that matters are coming to a head and the sooner the situation is resolved, the better. Howe said: âAt some stage there has to be a line drawn and things have to move forward. âThe club will always move forward. Weâve got some very good people in all departments doing some outstanding work that people donât see. Eddie Howe on Callum Wilson injury: ""Itâs a really strange injury, a tussle right at the end of the game.

It isâ¦ pic.twitter.com/JEZ7BJ7B57 â Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) February 16, 2024 âThe club is hugely ambitious and that has never changed. Iâve got no doubt the club will be successful in the future.â Howeâs comments came as he prepared his team for Saturdayâs Premier League clash with former club Bournemouth at St Jamesâ, a game England striker Callum Wilson will miss with a pectoral muscle injury for which he was due to undergo surgery on Friday and which is likely to sideline him for the bulk of what is left of the season, putting his Euro 2024 hopes in doubt. Howe said: âWe hoped initially he could carry on â and he felt good, actually, Callum, felt functionally fine. He was moving his arm and had full strength. âBut when he went to see a specialist, I think it was apparent quite early that he needed it operating on and I think heâs having that operation as we speak.â","âBut when he went to see a specialist, I think it was apparent quite early that he needed it operating on and I think heâs having that operation as we speak.â"
740,Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola urges Erling Haaland to relax,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Manchester-City-boss-Pep-Guardiola-urges-Erling-Haaland-to-relax/3300931,13 Feb,"Pep Guardiola has told Erling Haaland to focus more on getting his body language right than scoring goals. The Manchester City manager admitted to being concerned about the prolific Norwegianâs demeanour since his return to action following a two-month lay-off with a foot injury. Guardiola feels the striker has been preoccupied with adding to his remarkable goal tally and wants him to relax more. He thinks Saturdayâs victory over Everton was a good example, when Haaland had a quiet first half before netting twice late on to secure a 2-0 success. Erling Haaland scored twice in Manchester City  Guardiola, speaking in Denmark at a press conference to preview Tuesdayâs Champions League last-16 clash with FC Copenhagen, said: âErling is young, playing in the most difficult position on the pitch surrounded by four or five players with minor space. âIn the first half maybe we didnât have the special delivery players, like Kevin (De Bruyne) for example, who can find him. âIn that moment he has to be positive. When he scored a goal, he reacted but he doesnât need to score because he helps us for many things. âHe is defined on goals but it is not just scoring a goal. As much itâs how he is clapping, encouraging his mates and the first intense press. This is what we need from Erling. âBut we cannot forget he has been two months out, which is a lot of time for a guy who is so tall. âBack to the dynamic is not easy. Heâs a huge competitor who wants to score goals. OK, we know that, so relax. âIf we donât score today, or if he doesnât score in 10 minutes, itâs OK. In the process he has to try because the team always wins when they overcome bad moments.â Guardiola did stress this was a minor problem and he has no doubts about the 23-year-old. âIt looks like I am complaining about Erling but it was in general,â the City boss said. âHow many games did Erling play and how many goals? His body language is not a problem. âIf he doesnât score tomorrow, the day after or next week, itâs not a big issue. âHeâs so strong. It comes from nature. Heâs coped perfectly because heâs so strong mentally. He scores one goal and wants a second and a third. âYou see his numbers at his age. In the Champions League not even (Lionel) Messi or Cristiano (Ronaldo) had these numbers at his age.â Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola during a press conference at the Parken Stadium nchester City Press Conference â Parken Stadium â Monday 12th February  City are hoping to silence a raucous atmosphere at Parken to take the initiative after the first leg of their tie against Copenhagen. The Danes have not played competitively for two months due to their winter break but Guardiola expects a stern challenge from a side that finished above Manchester United and Galatasaray in their group. He said: âI would say they are starving to compete and hungry and have full energy, fresh in legs and mind. âI donât know the rhythm but they have had lots of time to prepare for the game. Hopefully we can be in a good level to compete. âItâs back to business in the competition but huge respect for the opponents. It was not an easy group and they did really well in all the games.â",âItâs back to business in the competition but huge respect for the opponents.

741,Lazio pile pressure on Bayern Munich and Thomas Tuchel with first-leg victory,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Lazio-pile-pressure-on-Bayern-Munich-and-Thomas-Tuchel-with-first-leg-victory/3302031,1 day ago,"Harry Kane made little impact as Bayern Munichâs week went from bad to worse following a shock 1-0 loss in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with Lazio. Ciro Immobileâs second-half penalty proved the difference at Stadio Olimpico to pile pressure on Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel on the back of a damaging 3-0 defeat at title rivals Bayer Leverkusen. England captain Kane, who is one short of reaching 50 club goals in European competition, barely touched the ball during a tight battle between two former Chelsea managers in the Italian capital. His side dominated possession before Maurizio Sarriâs men snatched a slender aggregate advantage when Immobile sent Manuel Neuer the wrong way from 12 yards in the 69th minute after Dayot Upamecano was dismissed for a late challenge on Gustav Isaksen. Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala went closest for the German club, who have plenty to do in the return match at Allianz Arena on March 5. Bayern arrived in Rome having fallen five points off the pace in the Bundesliga following Saturdayâs emphatic loss at Leverkusen. Under-fire boss Tuchel made three personnel changes in a bid to bounce back, including dropping Eric Dier and recalling Germany internationals Joshua Kimmich and Thomas Muller. Kimmich curled wide in the opening exchanges before Kane could not keep a close-range effort down following Mullerâs pull back, while Luis Alberto lashed over from distance for the side sitting seventh in Serie A. Thomas Tuchel  Former Manchester City forward Sane went close when his 32nd-minute effort whistled past the left post after Leon Goretzka and Muller shifted the angle of a free-kick on the edge of the D. Musiala then fired over following impressive build-up play as the away side failed to register an attempt on target before the break. Bayern beat Lazio 6-2 on aggregate as reigning champions at the same stage of the tournament in 2020-21 and were heavy favourites to repeat that feat. Yet, having been relatively untested defensively, the visitors nearly conceded within three minutes of the restart. Danish forward Isaksen was sent clear on goal after Bayern centre-back Upamecano was dispossessed by former Liverpool man Alberto, only for his low effort to be repelled by the legs of Neuer. The six-time European champions were struggling to regain the upper hand and felt aggrieved to fall behind 21 minutes from time during a pivotal moment in the match. French referee Francois Letexier pointed to the spot and brandished a red card after Upamecano caught Isaksen with his studs inside the box. Bayern were unhappy with the decision but that did not stop Immobile â fresh from scoring his 200th Serie A goal in Saturdayâs 3-1 win at Cagliari â calmly rolling home into the bottom right corner. Former Tottenham striker Kane saw a long-rang free-kick deflected over as below-par Bayern sought a leveller. Yet the surprise result could have been worse. Felipe Anderson and substitute Pedro each went close to doubling Lazioâs lead late on, with Tuchel given plenty to ponder.","Felipe Anderson and substitute Pedro each went close to doubling Lazioâs lead late on, with Tuchel given plenty to ponder."
742,Where are they now? Schalkeâs 2011 Champions League semi-finalists,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Where-are-they-now-Schalke%E2%80%99s-2011-Champions-League-semi-finalists/3299050,11 Feb,"In 2011, Bundesliga strugglers Schalke upset all the odds to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, where they faced Manchester United.  The 2010-11 season was a strange one for Schalke. They struggled in the league and sacked Felix Magath as manager in March, suggesting he had âlost the teamâ â but he had just guided the side to the Champions League quarter-finals and the final of the DFB-Pokal. Ralf Rangnick took over and continued the good work away from the league as Schalke saw off Duisburg in the domestic cup final and beat Inter Milan 5-2 in the San Siro on their way to the semi-final of Europeâs premier competition. 12 years on, a perilous financial situation means the club are facing the threat of relegation from Germanyâs second tier into the 3. Liga and thus the very real prospect of extinction. Itâs been a frighteningly quick downfall brought on by bad fortune and even worse management from the top down. Harking back to the glory days of 2011, weâve looked back at the team that started the 2-1 second-leg victory over Inter to see what theyâre up to nowadays. You might have heard of him. Just turned 24, Neuer was in his final season at Schalke. With Manchester United also lurking, he chose Bayern Munich, where he went on to establish himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. Now 37, his best days mightâve passed him by, but heâs still capable of some pretty extraordinary things â even after recovering from a self-inflicted broken leg which left his employers pretty angry. Uchida is apparently very popular in his homeland, where he earned the nickname âJapanese Beckhamâ. Such was his popularity that Schalke launched a website and Twitter account in Japanese. The full-back also voiced the character Uschi in a PokÃ©mon movie. He retired in 2020 and has since tried his hand at coaching, working with Japanâs under-19 side. We still think the PokÃ©mon side hustle is way cooler. Signed from Olympiacos the previous summer aged just 18, Papadopoulos was considered one of the hot prospects in Europe, and his defensive displays caught the attention of a number of clubs during his first two seasons at Schalke before injury saw him miss more than a year. After spending the majority of the 2010s in German football, Papadopoulos has enjoyed a nomadic 2020s, playing in Croatia, Saudi Arabia and Romania. Heâs currently back in Greece with Lamia. After three years with Real Madrid, Metzelder chose to return to his native Germany in 2010, rejoining Schalke, where he had spent some of his youth career. Injury forced him to retire aged 32. In 2021, he was sentenced to a 10-month suspended prison sentence for owning and distributing child pornography. Still playing for Liverpool, Matip remains a world class defender on his day, but cannot stay fit for the life of him. Considering they signed him from Schalke for free, though, itâs been pretty outstanding business for the Reds. An exceptional servant thus far. Schalke proved to be the last club that the Ghanaian full-back would play for, but in 2016 he did host a Netflix obstacle course show called âUltimate Beastmasterâ. Swings and roundabouts. Technically the fourth centre-back in Schalkeâs line-up for the match, Howedes played as a midfielder as Rangnick looked to completely shut up shop with a three-goal lead from the first leg. Not that this shackled the huge figure, as he raced forward with nine minutes to play to rattle home and put the icing on the cake. Youâd be forgiven for forgetting that he spent a season on loan at Juventus in 2017-18, before joining Lokomotiv Moscow in 2018 and eventually retiring in 2020. Heâs spent the last few years plugging away on coaching courses. Expect him on a touchline near you imminently.  If youâre thinking âthe name kind of rings a bellâ thatâs because he spent a year with Watford before returning to his homeland and joining Espanyol with manager Quique Sanchez Flores. Schmitz, whose introduction meant that by the end of the game Schalke had seven defenders on the pitch, was last seen playing for Dutch outfit VVV-Venlo in 2021. Now 37, attacking midfielder Baumjohann moved to Brazil in 2016, where his wife was born. Because Brazil wasnât hot enough, though, he moved to Australia in 2018 and now works as a football executive for Sydney FC, where he ended his playing career in 2021. Just 17 at the time, Draxler made an impressive 24 appearances in all competitions during this season. In the most unsurprising turn of events possible, Draxler these days kicks a ball around a pitch in Qatar for Al Ahli. He never made that move to Arsenal, despite being linked seemingly every transfer window. The striker moved to Schalke along with Metzelder as his illustrious Real Madrid career drew to a close. But he wasnât done, as he netted 19 goals in all competitions, including five in the Champions League, and the opener in this particular match. He also provided the assist for Howedesâ goal. Legend. Heâs currently in charge of Real Madrid Castilla and his daughter plays for the clubâs under-15 side. We bet his finishing is still just as outrageous.

743,On this day in 2012: Luis Suarez apologises for not shaking Patrice Evraâs hand,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/On-this-day-in-2012-Luis-Suarez-apologises-for-not-shaking-Patrice-Evra%E2%80%99s-hand/3300745,12 Feb,"On this day in 2012, Liverpool striker Luis Suarez apologised for not shaking Manchester United defender Patrice Evraâs hand before the match on the previous day at Old Trafford. The Uruguayan was banned for eight matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Evra in October 2011 during a league game between the sides at Anfield in October. Suarez had been expected to shake hands with the defender but failed to do so and prompted an angry reaction. Luis Suarez  âI have spoken with the manager (Kenny Dalglish) since the game at Old Trafford and I realise I got things wrong,â Suarez said in a statement. âIâve not only let him down but also the club and what it stands for and Iâm sorry. I made a mistake and I regret what happened. âI should have shaken Patrice Evraâs hand before the game and I want to apologise for my actions. âI would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on playing football.â Suarez scored in a 2-1 defeat for Liverpool, with Evra appearing to taunt him by celebrating next to him at the end of the game. Patrice Evra  Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre claimed Suarez had misled the club after the striker indicated he would shake hands with Evra ahead of the game. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson described Suarez as âa disgraceâ while Professional Footballersâ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor branded the strikerâs conduct as âdisrespectful, inappropriate and embarrassingâ.

744,Former Ajax footballer is sentenced to SIX YEARS in prison for smuggling cocaine,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Former-Ajax-footballer-is-sentenced-to-SIX-YEARS-in-prison-for-smuggling-cocaine/3301677,2 days ago,"Former Ajax star Quincy Promes has been handed a six-year prison sentence for his involvement in smuggling over 1,350 kilos of cocaine.  Promes was charged last May over his alleged involvement in smuggling the cocaine, which was intercepted in Antwerp in January 2020 in the form of two batches of 650kg and 713kg each. Now, the Public Prosecution Service have officially found Promes and a 32-year-old co-suspect, guilty of importing, exporting, transporting and possessing the drugs. It is alleged the cocaine was hidden in a shipment of sea salt from Brazil, where the drugs were transported from in two containers to Antwerp. According to NOS, the former Ajax winger failed to turn up for the trial and, thus, never made a statement about the offenses charged against him.  Further reports suggested that the former Netherlands international feels 'he's untouchable' - given the fact he avoided attending the court dates. According to NL Times, prosecutors said: 'He seems to think he is untouchable in Russia or abroad'. It's also reported that prosecutors wanted to know 'how such a successful footballer allowed himself to be drawn so deeply into crime.' Dutch officials had initially sought out a nine-year prison sentence for the Spartak Moscow forward, when the case was brought forward last month. When demanding the nine-year sentence, prosecutors alleged that Promes 'normalises and almost romanticises the cocaine trade'. Prosecutors claim Promes' wealth meant he had money to invest and was one step higher on the organisational ladder as a result. 'The case came to light after the police Criminal Intelligence Team received information that the 32-year-old man who now lives in Russia was involved in the cocaine trade,' the Dutch Public Prosecution Service said. 'He is also said to own crypto phones and has invested 200,000 euros in the trade.  'That information prompted an investigation to be launched. Eavesdropping equipment was placed in the suspect's car and the suspect was observed. 'The accuracy of the TCI information was confirmed, partly by seized telephones from others in which conversations were found in which the suspects also participated. 'Many chat messages made it clear that both suspects were involved in bringing in, removing and further transporting and selling these two consignments.' Back in June, Promes was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stabbing his cousin. The 31-year-old forward, who plays for Russian club Spartak Moscow, was arrested in December 2020 regarding the incident which happened in July that year. The court in the Netherlands found charges of assault against Promes proven, but found there was no attempted murder or manslaughter, according to ESPN. The stabbing, to the leg, occurred at a family party at a warehouse in Abcoude after Promes got into an argument over a stolen necklace. He was playing in the Netherlands for Ajax at the time but moved to Spartak in February 2021.  Similarly to his recent charges, the judge criticised Promes for not coming to the court to defend himself or expressing any remorse. His sentence would have been six months less had he done so. He was ordered to pay â¬7,000 [Â£5,973] in compensation to the victim. The Amsterdam-born forward played 50 times for the Dutch national team, scoring seven goals. Starting his career at Twente, he had a four-year stint with Spartak between 2014 and 2018 before signing for Spanish club Sevilla. From there, he spent a season-and-a-half with Ajax before returning to Spartak.","From there, he spent a season-and-a-half with Ajax before returning to Spartak."
745,Man United 'shortlistÂ Â£100m Bayer Leverkusen defensive duo',https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-United-shortlist%C2%A0%C2%A3100m-Bayer-Leverkusen-defensive-duo/3301249,13 Feb,"Manchester United have reportedly targeted Bayer Leverkusen stars Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba as the Premier League giants seek to reinforce their defence this summer.  The duo have played a key part in Leverkusen's stunning Bundesliga season, with Xabi Alonso's side now five points clear at the top of the table. Leverkusen had extended their lead by earning a dominant 3-0 win over reigning champions Bayern Munich on Saturday, with Frimpong scoring the third in stoppage time. The league leaders have conceded just 14 goals in 21 matches this season. Frimpong and Tapsoba have been central to Leverkusen's superb defensive record, with the Manchester Evening News reporting that Man United have been keeping tabs on their progress.  Right back Frimpong has previously been linked with a move to Old Trafford, with the Dutch defender reportedly been shortlisted by the club last summer. The 23-year-old had previously been in Man City's academy but did not make a senior appearance for the club. Frimpong spent two seasons at Celtic before moving onto Leverkusen in 2021. The highly rated full back, who has made 27 appearances in all competitions this season, signed a contract extension until 2028 back in October. Interest in Frimpong comes with Aaron Wan-Bissaka facing an uncertain future at Old Trafford after United triggered the 12-month extension in his contract in December having decided not to offer the defender a new long-term deal. The 26-year-old's agents are understood to have held further contract talks with United last month but the outcome was not positive.  Man United have reportedly earmarked Burkina Faso star Tapsoba as a young and athletic centre half ahead of next season. The 25-year-old, who is also contracted until 2028, has made 25 appearances for Leverkusen this season. Tapsoba has long been included on Man United's list of potential centre back options. Interest in Taspoba comes with Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans out of contract this summer, along with continuing doubts over Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof's future.","Interest in Taspoba comes with Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans out of contract this summer, along with continuing doubts over Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof's future."
746,De Ligt hands Man Utd transfer boost with bombshell Bayern Munich admission,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/De-Ligt-hands-Man-Utd-transfer-boost-with-bombshell-Bayern-Munich-admission/3300915,13 Feb,"Matthijs de Ligt's future at Bayern Munich is back in doubt - putting Manchester United back on red alert.  The Dutch defender only joined Bayern in 2022 but has long been admired by some at Old Trafford, most notably Erik ten Hag with whom he shone at former club Ajax. As Ten Hag looks towards further strengthening his squad this summer, developments in Bavaria could see growing interest from both parties when it comes to a reunion. De Ligt has fallen down the pecking order at Bayern under Thomas Tuchel this term, with Dayot Upamecano and Kim Min-Jae preferred. There were reports that the relationship between Tuchel and De Ligt had become strained. It was claimed in January that the latter was dissatisfied with his lack of game time in Bavaria and could seek a move sooner rather than later. The situation has not improved since. The 24-year-old has made just eight league starts so far this season, while he was also left on the bench for Saturdayâs 3-0 humbling against title rivals Bayer Leverkusen. De Ligt barely hid his frustrations while sitting on the bench and couldn't resist a subtle dig at his manager when asked post-game if he was fit enough to play. ""Top fit"" came his simple reply. De Ligt has three-and-a-half years left to run on his current Bayern Munich contract. He joined from Italian giants Juventus back in July 2022. Tuchel has previously claimed the club has no intention of selling the Dutchman, stating last month: âMatthijs came back injured from the national team and missed all pre-season. âWe played him a bit too early in the Super Cup, then he got seriously injured again and Min-jae and Upa [Upamecano] were starting games. But of course weâre planning with Matthijs, he is our player, a top player and a top character.â But with De Ligt seemingly down as fourth choice at the heart of Bayern's defence, there will be more than few pricked eyebrows in Manchester, where the likes of Raphael Varane, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof could all be available this summer.

747,Quincy Promes' 6-year jail sentence for cocaine smuggling but star avoiding jail,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Quincy-Promes-6-year-jail-sentence-for-cocaine-smuggling-but-star-avoiding-jail/3301791,2 days ago,"Quincy Promes has been handed a six-year jail sentence after being found guilty of a role in a 1,350kg cocaine smuggling operation - but the âuntouchableâ former Netherlands international may not serve any time.  Promes, who did not attend his trial, currently plays for Spartak Moscow and there is no extradition agreement between his homeland and Russia. The 32-year-old was charged last May over his alleged involvement in a smuggling operation that ended with two batches of cocaine, weighing 650kg and 713kg, being intercepted in Antwerp in January 2020. Promes and a 32-year-old co-suspect have been found guilty of importing, exporting, transporting and possessing the drugs. He has not made any statement in relation to the trial, with prosecutors telling Dutch media: âHe seems to think he is untouchable in Russia or abroad.â The Public Prosecution Service said of the case: âThe case came to light after the police Criminal Intelligence Team received information that the 32-year-old man who now lives in Russia was involved in the cocaine trade. âHe is also said to own crypto phones and has invested 200,000 euros in the trade.

He was playing for Ajax at the time of the incident but joined Spartak in February 2021.

748,Kane blanks as Bayern Munich's latest defeat leaves Thomas Tuchel under pressure,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kane-blanks-as-Bayern-Munichs-latest-defeat-leaves-Thomas-Tuchel-under-pressure/3302108,1 day ago,"Harry Kane was unable to stop Bayern Munich's season from further imploding as the German giants lost 1-0 to Lazio in the Champions League last-16 - and had a man sent off.  Dayot Upamecano saw red for a late tackle on Danish winger Gustav Isaksen midway through the second half, allowing Lazio's talisman, Ciro Immobile, to score past Manuel Neuer from the penalty spot. Thomas Tuchel cut a miserable figure in the Bayern dugout, as pressure on his position increases after three defeats from their last six games. Bayern were thumped 3-0 on Saturday by title rivals Bayer Leverkusen, who now boast a five-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. 2012 was the last time another side claimed the German title but Bayern's grip is looser than ever, with Tuchel having only been in charge for less than a year. As a humbled Bayern squad travelled to the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday, star signing Kane was unable to repeat his heroics at the same stadium where he broke England's all-time goalscoring record 11 months ago. The ex- Tottenham hero - who had just 12 touches in the first half, three in the penalty box all game - and his Bayern teammates failed to assert themselves on Maurizio Sarri's team, who found joy on the counter. Kane was left to rue just one clear-cut goalscoring chance, a first-half shot which he leant back on and skewed over the the crossbar. Bayern were then unable to break the deadlock early in the second period before a clumsy challenge from Upamecano gave Lazio a huge helping hand in their bid to reach the quarter-finals. It wasn't all rosy for Sarri and co, however, as striker Immobile had to be withdrawn due to injury during Bayern's late but tame rally. Fortunately for the hosts, their back line held firm and goalkeeper Ivan Provedel was hardly troubled, as the Bundesliga champions didn't even manage a shot on target. Meanwhile in Paris for the other last-16 tie, Kylian Mbappe's 58th-minute goal helped give PSG a 2-0 advantage in their clash with Spaniards Real Sociedad. The French superstar was visibly unhappy during the first half but within 13 minutes of the restart, he found himself free at the far post to clinically convert a flick-on from Marquinhos. It wasn't an entirely convincing performance from PSG, though, as Luis Enrique's men struggled to suffocate the away side, who failed to score for the fifth successive game in all competitions, despite having chances. Japanese winger Takefusa Kuba, formerly of Real Madrid and Barcelona, frequently caused problems down the right flank but it was a long-range effort from ex- Newcastle midfielder Mikel Merino which rattled the crossbar just before half-time. PSG made them pay just prior to the hour mark, with Ousmane Dembele's outswinging corner finding captain Marquinhos. The Brazilian nodded the ball on and somehow Mbappe was in acres to prod home past Alex Remiro. Real Sociedad were then given a mountain to climb in the second leg on March 5 when Bradley Barcola made it two with 20 minutes to go.

Victory in this tie would keep Barcelona in third place in the table but with a three point gap in behind second place Girona.

United boss Erik ten Hag has been delighted how five-time Champions League winner Casemiro has taken a personal interest in ensuring 18-year-old Mainoo maximises his outstanding potential. The pair will be on duty for in-form United at Aston Villa with a winning closing the gap on a top-four place. âYou can see the impact of a player like Casemiro. He gives you calmness and composure on the ball and sees the critical pass,â said ten Hag. âKobbie is very coachable and they have a bond. Casemiro has the experience that can accelerate his development.   âCasemiro takes that responsibility. He talks to Kobbie. I see it in the dressing room, in training and on the pitch in games. 'Of course he looking at his own game but heâs trying to help and support Kobbie.â The picture of youngsters Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Mainoo celebrating a goal together against West Ham last weekend encapsulated a new feeling of optimism at United following a frustrating season. However, they are eight points behind Villa in the race for a Champions League spot which ten Hag confesses: âIt is very important to play Champions League and that is our target, absolutely.â âItâs easier to integrate young talent into a successful team but I donât think this club has been in that situation for a long time. âThe conditions where we had to bring in Kobbie Mainoo were not so good but when I brought him in I didnât have any doubts.â Garnacho scored twice against West Ham and has thrived playing wide on the right â even though he prefers the left. âHe is a player who is fluid and can be both positions or even inside. He feels very comfortable,â said ten Hag. United have won their last three matches in all competitions and are unbeaten in five. In the reverse fixture against Villa, they came from 2-0 down at Old Trafford to win 3-2 and have since received the boost of billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe buying a 25% stake in the club.","In the reverse fixture against Villa, they came from 2-0 down at Old Trafford to win 3-2 and have since received the boost of billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe buying a 25% stake in the club."
753,Is Carlos Vela going back to LAFC for the 2024 MLS season?,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Is-Carlos-Vela-going-back-to-LAFC-for-the-2024-MLS-season/3300970,13 Feb,"Steve Cherundolo, coach of LAFC, spoke about the possible return of the Mexican to the MLS side for the upcoming season.  Carlos Velaâs position is to return with Los Angeles FC for his seventh year in Major League Soccer season in search of winning more titles. John Thorrington, General Manager of the team, commented that LAFCâs intentions are for him to return since they believe he still has a lot to give to the franchise. While negotiations continue, Los Angeles FC are in the Coachella Valley playing friendly matches ahead of the start of the 2024 campaign. For now Steve Cherundolo, coach of the âBlack & Goldâ, is preparing the team for life without Carlos Vela in case negotiations break down with the season set to start shortly. âWe continue working on completing the squad,â Cherundolo began by saying. âSo we are not ready yet, but for the players who are here, including Eduard Atuesta, they are all in good physical condition. âWe are not where we want to be yet, but it is something we will work on in the next two weeks.â âItâs different without Carlos, but we love him. We would love to have him here. Who knows, maybe we will find a solution for him to return,â added Cherundolo. For his part, the Mexican is in the city of Los Angeles, California training on his own, waiting to reach an agreement with LAFC. Most likely, Carlos Vela would not play in the opening game against Seattle Sounders because he has to get to the same physical level as the rest of his teammates who have been in pre-season for four weeks. Both parties have until April 23 to reach an agreement, the deadline for the first transfer window of the 2024 MLS season.","Most likely, Carlos Vela would not play in the opening game against Seattle Sounders because he has to get to the same physical level as the rest of his teammates who have been in pre-season for four weeks.

754,Why Chelsea won't commit to the player everyone loves - Conor Gallagher,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Why-Chelsea-wont-commit-to-the-player-everyone-loves---Conor-Gallagher/3301577,2 days ago,"Conor Gallagher wants to stay at Chelsea. Mauricio Pochettino wants Gallagher to stay. The resolution, therefore, appears rather simple.  The truth is far more complicated. Gallagherâs match-winning brace at Crystal Palace on Monday night has intensified the focus on the England internationalâs future. Re-signing the 24-year-old appears a no-brainer. The supporters love him. His team-mates loves him. More pertinently, his manager loves him. Privately, Pochettino has forcefully advanced the merits of agreeing a new contract for Gallagher with his superiors.   That will come as no surprise. A rare bright spark in what has been a mediocre campaign. Gallagher has captained the team regularly in the absence of injured duo Reece James and Ben Chilwell. Heâs made the most Premier League starts of any Chelsea player. Heâs been the standard bearer at the clubâs Cobham training ground, during a period that insiders say have fallen way short of what is expected. Pochettinoâs reliance on Gallagher is clear.  What isnât quite so definitive is how Chelseaâs hierarchy view Gallagherâs future. Pochettino has done what he can, but the clubâs failure to assemble a contractual package that would satisfy a player of Gallagherâs standing has led to uncertainty. Pochettino recognises the benefits: the infectious work-rate and tenacity. He also sees the intangibles: the exemplary attitude, his respectful and courteous nature. When Gallagher arrived in the Midlands to join West Brom on loan in September 2000, he took an instant decision to relocate from London. It was an assertive decision that impressed then manager Slaven Bilic. Loan moves often leave footballers in limbo in terms of living arrangements, but Gallagherâs decision to uproot left an indelible mark on those at the Hawthorns. It was that commitment that endeared him to those at Crystal Palace during his impressive loan spell there during the the 2021/22 season. âNot a moment's trouble,â said one leading football figure who has worked closely with Gallagher. So whatâs the problem? On the pitch, there remains some doubts. While he walks into a Chelsea team in its current state of flux, would he play regularly in a Blues side more in line with where they hope their future takes them? âHis work rate is unquestionable, his ability to hustle opponents and win the ball back is perhaps his most valuable asset,â said one well-placed source. âBut thereâs always been a doubt over the technical side of his game.â In deliberating whether to hand Gallagher his first England call up ahead of Qatar 2022, Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland identified his best attribute as coming off the bench to win the ball higher up the pitch rather than his abilities in possession.   So with that in mind it is, perhaps, understandable Chelsea are believed to be reluctant to go above their unofficial wage ceiling of around Â£150,000-per-week. In todayâs market, it is fair to say Gallagher is worth more than that wage, particularly if you consider fellow academy graduate Reece James, who signed his latest deal under the Todd Boehly/Clearlake regime, earns Â£250,000-per-week. Indeed, Chelsea could, like they did with James, make an exception if they really wanted to. The fact they havenât done so yet speaks volumes. Those close to Gallagher will tell you his next contract will be driven by the need to feel wanted, not money. But those advising Gallagher, who currently earns in the region of Â£60,000-per-week, would be foolish to undersell a midfielder who has an excellent chance of going to Euro 2024 this summer. Gallagher is entering the final 12 months of his current deal and Chelsea are private acknowledging his value will drop drastically between now and the summer. Chelsea would have entertained offers of between Â£50m-Â£60m in January. But his value may have halved by the time the summer window opens.    There is also the issue of the Premier Leagueâs profit and sustainability rules (PSR) to consider. Well-placed sources have indicated that Chelsea are flying uncomfortably close to the wind in terms complying with the regulations. In Gallagher - and striker Armando Broja who is currently on loan at Fulham - they have assets who will count as 100 percent profit on the PSR balance sheet. Chelsea have already shown they are prepared to sell their own to ensure their financial stability such as when Mason Mount departed to join Manchester United last summer. Tottenham have a solid interest in Gallagher and are open to negotiating this summer â though Gallagher is from a Chelsea-mad family and a move to north London may not sit well with them. But Mail Sport understands he would prioritise staying in the south if he does go, leaving the door open for Spurs.","Tottenham have a solid interest in Gallagher and are open to negotiating this summer â though Gallagher is from a Chelsea-mad family and a move to north London may not sit well with them.

755,Mourinho believes Sir Jim Ratcliffe will help restore Man Utd to former glories,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mourinho-believes-Sir-Jim-Ratcliffe-will-help-restore-Man-Utd-to-former-glories/3302226,1 day ago,"Jose Mourinho believes Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival at Manchester United will help restore the club to past glories after over a decade of decline.  The Portuguese coach, 61, experienced first-hand the ownership of the unpopular Glazer family during his time in charge at Old Trafford between 2016 and 2018. Ineos billionaire Ratcliffe has paid Â£1.3bn for a 25 per cent stake in United and control of football operations, with the Premier League approving the deal this week. Ratcliffe has wasted little time getting down to business with Omar Berrada moving from rivals Manchester City to replace Richard Arnold as chief executive and Newcastle's Dan Ashworth lined up as sporting director. Mourinho has told ex-United defender Rio Ferdinand on his FIVE podcast that Ratcliffe will change things for the better.   'Ineos and Ratcliffe, I know him well and we have a good relationship with years ago,' Football.com global ambassador Mourinho said. 'I have a very good feeling, he is also a sports man, he loves it and that is a very important thing. 'He comes with experience from other experiences - smaller clubs, other sports, cycling. I have a good feeling things can go in the right direction and I honestly hope so.' Mourinho said he 'loved' his time in charge of United, which saw him win the EFL Cup and the Europa League in his first season before finishing second behind City in the Premier League. But he said the set-up behind the scenes at Old Trafford - which Ratcliffe is trying to shake up - didn't help him because he had no direct link to the Glazers. 'It is a historical club, a legendary club with legendary players. I was very, very happy and proud to be there,' he said. 'I don't think the media helped me, including yourself maybe.    'I didn't feel that was with an intention of hurting, it was more that people didn't understand the dimension of the job and the potential difficulties and the fact the coach was in a hybrid position because in the years before everything was very clear - the ownership was Sir Alex [Ferguson] and David Gill. 'Then it was changing, the structure was not very fluid. When people criticise Ed Woodward's job, I don't like it because for me he is a good man, he was just a man who probably was not like a fish in the water. 'Very intelligent, very polite, very correct but probably not prepared for the sports side of it. 'For a coach not to have a direct communication with the ownership, for a coach not to have a structure that shares the same principles and ideas was not very easy, with consequences at many levels.'","'For a coach not to have a direct communication with the ownership, for a coach not to have a structure that shares the same principles and ideas was not very easy, with consequences at many levels.'"

Bellingham nets brace,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Madrid-4-0-Girona-5-points-clear-at-top-of-La-Liga-Bellingham-nets-brace/3297684,11 Feb,"Jude Bellingham became the first midfielder this century to score 15 league goals in a season for Real Madrid as they put four past their closest La Liga rivals to take a huge stride towards the title.   With his first half strike at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday night Bellingham doubled Madridâs advantage over Girona after man-of-the-match Vinicus opened the scoring. He tapped in a second after the break before going off with an ankle problem that Madrid will now hope does not keep them out of their Champions League last-16 game next week against RB Leipzig. When he got his second and hobbled off âHey Judeâ wasnât just bouncing off the noisy South End of the stadium, it was reverberating around the whole arena. When he turned up last summer the comparisons with Zinedine Zidane seemed outlandish but the Frenchman never scored more than nine in the league in any one season. Bellingham has 16 now with most of the second half of the campaign left. This felt like a title decider with Girona just two points behind Real Madrid in the table â a football miracle at this stage of the season bearing in mind this is only their fourth season in the top flight.   They found Madrid too hot to handle however with the excellent Bellingham not even the best player on the pitch for the home side. That accolade went to Vinicius. He set up the first on seven minutes inflicting on Girona the first goal they have conceded from outside the area all season. He missed the last Real Madrid game pulling out late with a pain in the neck in the warm-up. Now the pain was all Gironaâs as he cut in from the left and put the ball into the top corner from the edge of the area. There was a square of defenders around him with a Girona player on every corner but they were all spectators as his shot flew in. The visitors had bossed the opening exchanges but from nothing Vinicius had conjured the opening goal of the game. Kylian Mbappeâs arrival to Madrid this summer is starting to feel inevitable but he might have to play through the middle instead of in his favoured starting position coming off the left onto his right foot because Madrid, in Vinicius, have someone who does that as well as anyone in the world. And if Mbappe plays through the middle what to do with Bellingham? He got the brilliant second charging on to pass from Vinicus that Luka Modric would have been proud of. He had Yan Couto in front of him but the Brazilian bent the ball around him and perfectly into the path of the galloping England midfielder who had split the centre of Gironaâs defence with his run. Bellingham dropped a shoulder and rounded keeper Paulo Gazzaniga before scoring from a tight angle. The early goals took the pressure off a Madrid starting eleven that didnât contain a single central defender. Ever since Antonio Rudiger went, juggernaut style, through Mason Greenwood, and came off worse than the Getafe winger, he has been struggling and he did not make the starting line-up. With David Alaba and Eder Militao also out long-term and Nacho carrying a knock, Carlo Ancelotti had to pair full-back Dani Carvajal and midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni in the centre of the back four but they were untroubled in the first half. Girona had their first effort on target at the restart when Miguel Gutierrez got forward from left-back. The former Madrid youth team player â who Madrid still have an 8m euros option on â gave Andriy Lunin something to do with a dangerous cross that he palmed away. Savinho, the Brazilian winger who Manchester City have signed for the end of the season, then skipped away from Lucas Vazquez as Michelâs team continued to show more in the opening minutes of the second period than in all of the first. Girona have been comeback kings this season; they have no shortage of resilience but against this much Bellingham and Vinicius it was all in vain. Bellingham had twisted his left ankle earlier in the game and was about to be taken off by a concerned Ancelotti but he still had one more goal in him. Vinicus was again surrounded by Girona defenders, this time on the right wing, and again he got away from them. His crossed was blocked by Gazzaniga but Bellingham tapped it in from close range. He was immediately replaced by Brahim Diaz and Hey Jude rang around the stadium as he went off blowing kisses to the Madrid public he has had in the palm of his hands since his first game. Madrid were just as dangerous despite losing Bellingham. He was having his ankle bandaged on the bench as Rodrygo swept forward, benefiting from Vinicus winning the ball back, to score the fourth. Joselu missed a penalty with the last kick of the game after Arda Guler had been fouled. Girona had long since just wanted it to be over and when the penalty came back off the post it was. So, quite possibly, is the Spanish title race. 0' The match is about to start!  6' VINI JR. with an absolute screamer to open the scoring!!

758,Pep's brain is whirring again! Why experiments never stop for City's tinkerman,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Peps-brain-is-whirring-again-Why-experiments-never-stop-for-Citys-tinkerman/3300711,12 Feb,"Pep Guardiola has been here so long that his seasons are now following patterns. Doubt is cast over Manchester City before Christmas, they roar back around New Year and in February, the manager starts trying new things.  This time last year came the inventive switch of John Stones into midfield, which became the cornerstone of their run to the Treble. Stones has had a troubling season with injuries this time though and City largely ditched that in his absence. But Guardiola is always searching for new ways to stay ahead. At times Kyle Walker has been told to stay high and wide, more so than ever before, and the past seven days have brought another couple of tweaks which could suggest Guardiola is feeling his way into a new innovation. At Brentford last Monday, City effectively went without a left winger. Phil Foden was named out there yet spent most of his night in the middle and ended up with a second career hat-trick. Josko Gvardiol roamed backward and forward almost alone. And on Saturday, in the opening exchanges of what proved a tricky assignment against a stubborn Everton, came something else new. Manuel Akanji was named at left back for his comeback from injury and Stones stationed himself at right back. City are adept at one defender jumping up alongside Rodri in possession, but here Guardiola asked both full backs simultaneously. It is rare.   The experiment was only brief, in the opening 15 minutes or so, before Akanji and centre back Nathan Ake switched places, but points to Guardiolaâs willingness to try fresh ideas. Other than the element of surprise at this stage in a season, it also serves to keep his players engaged and with something to think about. âWe tried but it didnât work for the way Everton defended,â Guardiola said. âManu didnât feel comfortable so we changed our structure.â City had anticipated a five-man defence rather than the four Sean Dyche picked. There had been some uncertainty, especially with Akanji, on when and where to force the issue in possession. âThe system changed on the ball,â Ake said. âEveryone is capable of playing any position.â And there, in that second sentence, Ake nailed why City will feel confident of adding more silverware this season. Guardiolaâs brain is whirring and he benefits from a pool of players who seem instantly capable of adapting to different tactical instructions. To fully go for a system that has two absolute defenders and then three in front on the ball, City need to be secure with their defensive record, which has not been at its usual level. This was only a second Premier League clean sheet in 13 matches, but there still came a suggestion that a new system, with its slight subtleties, could be something to watch for. âManu suffered the lack of rhythm and John a bit too,â Guardiola said. âWhen they moved inside last season they were incredible, now it is not so fluid. âWhy? It is because you are injured and then donât have the rhythm they need. But still they compete. âWe won all the games and now are there. How much we want it will be a problem for opponents.â Everton appeared comfortable managing City for large parts, with James Garner and Idrissa Gueye near-perfect in choosing when to mix it in the areas Guardiola wanted his full backs to exploit. Then Kevin De Bruyne came on and Erling Haaland did his thing.  âWe got punished off a dubious corner,â Everton defender James Tarkowski said. âOnce again, another decision goes against us, but thereâs nothing we can do about that. âYou go and speak to the ref and itâs like, âWeâll look at itâ. Well, itâs no good looking at it now, is it? We need you to look at it on the pitch and get it right. They say we apologise for this, we apologise for that, but itâs not good enough. âI didnât think they (City) were creating much. I didnât feel we were in loads of danger. âDonât worry about us, weâre ready to go no matter what. Itâs been a good season. Iâm not disappointed. Weâre going well.â Despite Tarkowskiâs optimism, Everton are seven without a win.","Despite Tarkowskiâs optimism, Everton are seven without a win."

Los Blancos were missing Jude Bellingham, but Brahim Diaz, who produced the standout moment of quality,  was a large part of the reason they did not miss him.  Brahim has often operated as Bellinghamâs alternative this season, and before the match, Carlo Ancelotti pointed out that they had won all four of their matches without the English protege, a total that stands at five after the game. Brahim certainly resolved the match in classic Bellingham fashion. âIt was a very nice goal and play, I honestly donât know how many I went past, and I put it where I had to put it, where I didnât put it against Atletico. Since I was little I have used both legs, it is something I usually practice,â Brahim explained to Cadena SER after the match. âItâs Valentineâs Day in no time at all, and I can say that I am in love with Real Madrid,â Brahim laughed. He will hope that injury is not too serious, as will Ancelotti. There is a strong argument to say he has been one of their better players in 2024, and some are wondering whether he could come for Rodrygo Goesâ place. Bellingham and Vinicius Junior are unmovable through the middle and on the left, and Brahim is no doubt outperforming Rodrygo currently.","He will hope that injury is not too serious, as will Ancelotti.

Theo proved the matchwinner on Sunday. Pioli said: âTheo had put himself at our disposal as a central defender and he did it very well indeed, but naturally he has such a great rapport with Leao down the left, they know each other so well, can sniff each other out. âI think Theo struggled last season to get over the disappointment of the World Cup Final defeat, the strain of a tournament that was in the middle of the season. I was not sure how he would be mentally this season, but he was very positive. He has become a leader for this team, not one who talks that much, but with his attitude. âI think the games he played as a centre-back also showed him how much more focused, aggressive and important he can be when defending, and he is taking that into his role as a left-back now."" He added: âI had many meetings with the players over the last few weeks, demanding they show more concentration and be more solid in defence, less ready to immediately press high. The strikers also need to send the signal and spark attacking moves to be accompanied. âTonight's Milan was balanced, organised and above all worked hard, as Napoli forced us to work hard, and we did not hold back. Keeping a clean sheet in those circumstances should give us more confidence going forward.""","âTonight's Milan was balanced, organised and above all worked hard, as Napoli forced us to work hard, and we did not hold back.

761,Kylian Mbappe rested as PSG ease past Lille to extend Ligue 1 lead,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kylian-Mbappe-rested-as-PSG-ease-past-Lille-to-extend-Ligue-1-lead/3299182,11 Feb,"Kylian Mbappe was kept in reserve as Paris St Germain went 11 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 with 3-1 victory over Lille. Defender Alexsandro had a night to forget at the Parc des Princes when, after Yusuf Yazici had given the visitors an early lead, he was robbed to allow Goncalo Ramos to level and then sliced the ball into his own net before Randal Kolo Muani cemented the win. Mbappe was named only among the substitutes ahead of Wednesday nightâs Champions League last 16 clash with Real Sociedad, as were Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, Marquinhos and Warren Zaire-Emery. And Mbappe was not needed as Luis Enriqueâs side eased to victory, with fourth-placed Lille indebted to goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier for keeping the margin of defeat respectable. Mbappeâs presence on the bench as he nursed ankle injury did not come as a huge surprise despite Enriqueâs insistence in the run-up to the game that he would be involved, but 37-year-old Keylor Navasâ inclusion in place of Donnarumma, his first appearance for the club since May 2022, did prompt raised eyebrows. Navasâ evening got off to a bad start as Tiago Santos tricked his way past Lucas Beraldo and after Fabian Ruiz failed to deal with his cross, Yazici smashed the ball past the PSG keeper in the sixth minute. The lead last barely four minutes as Alexsandro was caught in possession and Ousmane Dembele squared for Ramos to equalise. PSGâs Fabian Ruiz (right) and Ousmane Dembele celebrate Lille defender Alexsandro  Alexsandroâs evening was to take a further turn for the worse with just 17 minutes played as the home side started to find their feet. Ramos sent the ball across the face of goal and when the visitors failed to deal with it, Fabian unleashed a speculative shot and the defender sliced an attempted clearance into his own net. Lille might have fallen further behind in first-half stoppage time but for Chevalierâs instinctive save with his foot after Marco Asensio had run on to Dembeleâs pull-back. Asensio was guilty of a poor 51st-minute miss after robbing Nabil Bentaleb on the edge of the penalty area, and Chevalier came to Alexsandroâs rescue with a block from Nordi Mukiele after he had forced his way past the defender. PSG celebrate after Randal Kolo Muani wraps up victory over Lille  Edon Zhegrova saw a 58th-minute attempt deflected wide at the other end after Gabriel Gudmundsson and Angel Gomes had combined to set him up, but it took another superb save from Chevalier to keep out Kolo Muaniâs 73rd-minute strike. The striker did get his name on the scoresheet with 10 minutes remaining when substitute Bradley Barcola broke down the left and crossed for him to cement victory. And Alexsandroâs misery was complete when he headed wastefully over when presented with a late chance to reduce the deficit.",And Alexsandroâs misery was complete when he headed wastefully over when presented with a late chance to reduce the deficit.
762,De Jong ready to U-turn on Barca stance as Man Utd reignite transfer interest,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/De-Jong-ready-to-U-turn-on-Barca-stance-as-Man-Utd-reignite-transfer-interest/3298852,11 Feb,"Frenkie de Jong has been linked with a move to Manchester United ever since the summer of 2022 when Erik ten Hag took the reins at Old Trafford.  United's Dutch manager is well versed in what De Jong's main strengths are, given the pair worked closely during their shared time at Eredivisie giants Ajax. Now at Barcelona, De Jong is often a name that crops up on the transfer wishlists of Premier League clubs. He has hardly set the world alight since his switch to the Camp Nou in 2019, but that would have been difficult considering the number of obstacles the club has faced on and off the pitch in that time. Regardless, in the past De Jong has pledged his loyalty to Barcelona. Looking back at comments from the Netherlands international made last summer, De Jong reaffirmed his commitment to the Barcelona cause. He told El Periodico: ""I always wanted to be at Barca. ""In these first years, we had not won the League, nor gone far in the Champions League. We had only won one Copa del Rey. To succeed at Barca I had a lot left. ""And I also saw that the team was improving that summer. High-level players arrived. And that's why I wanted to continue. It is the club of my dreams and I want to be here all my life. I didn't want to leave suddenly."" However, it seems like something has changed in the six months that have passed since those remarks from De Jong. Half a year later, it appears that the technically gifted midfield maestro is now more open to the idea of leaving Barcelona as speculation over a move to Manchester rears its head once again. The La Liga giants yet again find themselves in a precarious financial position and as a result, De Jong could be deemed as a sellable asset that would generate some much-needed funds. Ten Hag's stance on the talent is unlikely to have changed. In February of last year, ahead of a Europa League clash between the two teams, the United boss spoke glowingly of De Jong publicly. Ten Hag claimed: ""Frenkie is an incredible player and for every club in the whole world he will strengthen the squad because he has a unique quality. ""If you can get him in the squad your team will be stronger. In Spain, he became even better. He's a fantastic player, plays out from the back, he always has time and it was a pleasure to work with him.""","""If you can get him in the squad your team will be stronger.

763,MURPHY: Rice deserves standing ovation for performing at Arsenal as top signing,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/MURPHY-Rice-deserves-standing-ovation-for-performing-at-Arsenal-as-top-signing/3299188,11 Feb,"Declan Rice has made Arsenal even better, which is why he has been my signing of the season.  He has gone from West Ham with top-six ambitions to a club competing in the Champions League and for Premier League titles. Thatâs a very different kind of pressure but Rice has been fearless in coping both with the added scrutiny and a Â£100million price tag. He has adapted his game. He was able to focus on his defensive work at West Ham whereas Arsenal dominate possession so he needs to show ability on the ball and make productive passes. He has done all of that and popped up with the occasional important goal, too. The ease with which he has made the transition has surprised even me, despite having no doubts about his mentality. Rice has been Arsenalâs best player, which is hugely impressive given the quality that Mikel Arteta already possessed in the Gunners dressing room. Injury to Thomas Partey has meant Rice has played mostly as the deepest of Arsenalâs midfielders but, when Jorginho came in against Liverpool last Sunday, Rice had an opportunity to express himself and press higher up the pitch. Liverpool found his athleticism hard to cope with.  The 25-year-old returns today to London Stadium, where he was booed by a section of West Ham fans in the Carabao Cup earlier this season. It saddened rather than surprised me. There is a minority who judge him solely on joining another London club rather than the years of service he gave West Ham, including lifting a European trophy. If anyone deserves a standing ovation going to his former club, itâs Declan Rice and you will hear appreciation towards him from many West Ham fans. If a mindless few want to sing songs about him being greedy, thatâs rubbish. He wanted the chance to challenge for the biggest trophies, which he deserved. Rice could be up against his England pal Kalvin Phillips. Phillips has had a difficult start to life as a Hammer with a couple of mistakes that have led to goals. Would I start him against Arsenal? Absolutely.  This is a time a new signing needs the manager to keep faith. If David Moyes puts Phillips on the bench today, it will only give him a higher mountain to climb. I was in a similar situation when I left Liverpool for Charlton. I didnât start well and there was talk Alan Curbishley might leave me out against Birmingham. I had a chat with the manager, he stuck with me and I played well. It helped turn things around for me and Phillips has all the tools to do the same.","I was in a similar situation when I left Liverpool for Charlton.

The outlet understands that Liverpool winger Mohamed Salah (31) and Manchester City attacking midfielder Bernardo Silva (29) are part of the wishlist, alongside Napoli centre-forward Victor Osimhen (25).  With the highest-paid football player in Europe heading to pastures new, Les Parisiens are set to bank over â¬200m in savings â a motherlode fit to reshape the teamâs attacking force and more. LâEquipe understands that not a single player can replace MbappÃ©âs output for Les Parisiens with PSG considering a near-complete overhaul to kickstart the post-MbappÃ© era. The outlet adds that Osimhen will be the priority signing, should Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis were to lower his â¬150m demands for the Nigerian striker. The latter would not mind returning to Ligue 1 after his breakthrough season with Lille OSC, although Salah sounds like he has many admirers in Paris. The Egyptianâs name is said to be âcirculatingâ in the clubâs headquarters. The same can be said of Silva. MbappÃ©âs former teammate at Monaco is under contract until 2026 with Manchester City. Les Parisiens have made Silva a âdream signingâ and it appears the interest is reciprocal. LâEquipe understands that the Portugueseâs release clause is valued at â¬60m. Rafael LeaÃµ (24) is also being considered, despite his recent renewal with AC Milan until 2028. The outlet adds that PSG will try again to lure Joshua Kimmich (29) from Bayern Munich. The fact that the Germany international does not get along with Thomas Tuchel may play in Parisâ hands. Although, the executives may want to pursue a younger profile with Newcastle Unitedâs Bruno Guimaraes (26) or Barcelonaâs Gavi (19). PSG can also retain the services of Xavi Simons (20), who had a brilliant start of the season with RB Leipzig on loan. With MbappÃ© gone in a couple of months, a new era is set to start for Paris Saint-Germain, and they would want the players to show for it. GFFN | Bastien Cheval",GFFN | Bastien Cheval

Erik ten Hag is expected to be backed in the summer transfer window after the Red Devils failed to strengthen in January and it has already been outlined that the Dutchman has designs on overhauling his defensive options, with both Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans out of contract at the end of the season. There are also doubts over the long-term future of Victor Lindelof, whose contract was extended by 12 months earlier in the campaign. He could still be sold, especially given United in the market for two young centre-backs. That's according to a new report from The Mail, who claim that Branthwaite has emerged as United's top target. The highly-rated 21-year-old has enjoyed a fine season for Everton and is attracting interest from other top clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid. While United also have other names in mind to bolster their defence, it's outlined in the report that Branthwaite is United's primary target. Tottenham, like United, are also pushing hard to sign the centre-back ahead of the summer window. Branthwaite has already been given a glowing endorsement from United icon Ruud van Nistelrooy, who coached the youngster during his stint on loan at PSV Eindhoven. The former PSV head coach said of Branthwaite last year: ""He is a great talent. The boy is young, but he has a future. He is good on the ball, can play on the left or the right of centre-back because he is two-footed. He has height and speed, so he is very complete."" As well as renovating their defence, United are also in the market for attacking reinforcements and Crystal Palace 's Michael Olise is a target. Wolves wide-man Pedro Neto has also been touted as a possible signing according to the same report, although it should be noted that - like with Brantwaite - there is plenty of rival interest in the Portuguese star, who is also admired by Arsenal and Manchester City. Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt, who previously worked with Ten Hag at Ajax, is also understood to be on Manchester United's radar and is seemingly surplus to requirements at the German champions.","Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt, who previously worked with Ten Hag at Ajax, is also understood to be on Manchester United's radar and is seemingly surplus to requirements at the German champions."
766,Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson to manage Liverpool just for one day,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Sven-G%C3%B6ran-Eriksson-to-manage-Liverpool-just-for-one-day/3301360,14 Feb,"The Swedish coach has always wanted to manage the Reds. His wish will be fulfilled in next monthâs charity match against Ajax Legends at Anfield.  It was always at the back of Sven-GÃ¶ran Erikssonâs mind to one day occupy the bench at Anfield. The Swedish coach, who turned 76 last week, will finally see his dream come true next month when he will lead a team of Liverpool veterans against counterparts from Ajax in the annual Legends charity match. A club statement read:  âLiverpool FC is delighted to confirm Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson will be part of the LFC Legends management team for the game against Ajax Legends at Anfield, on 23 March. The former England boss will join a dugout of LFC greats, including Ian Rush, John Barnes and John Aldridge, for the annual LFC Foundation charity matchâ. One hundred per cent of the proceeds raised from the game will go towards supporting the work of LFC Foundation and its charity partners. The clubâs two previous legends games - against Manchester United in 2022 and Celtic last year raised a combined total of Â£1.45 million - funds which have gone to provide help for areas of high need and deprivation across Merseyside. Erikssonâs name was first mentioned for the role of guest manager of hosts in the Legends game last month, when he revealed that he has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. The coach is battling pancreatic cancer, which is believed to be at an advanced stage. The Swedish coach recently admitted being a lifelong Liverpool fan, following the team with the same passion his father since he was a boy growing up in Torsby. He explained that he had to hide his predilection for the Reds during his time as England manager as to not cause any misunderstandings. He confessed to Sky Sports back in 2010, âIâve always been a Liverpool fan. I can say that now, I couldnât say that when I was in England but I was always. My father as well, he is 90, and still is a Liverpool fanâ. The feeling is mutual. Liverpool as a club and a city has long enjoyed a special relationship with Scandinavia - a bond cemented forever not just by the players who arrived and went on to become Kop idols:  Jan Molby, Sami Hyypia, John Arne Riise, Danny Agger, Jari Litmanen, Stig Inge BjÃ¸rnebye, Glenn Hysen... Nordic sailors even gifted the city with its own dish - Scouse, a hearty stew adopted from the Scandinavian Lapskaus. Sven will oversee next monthâs match from the dug-out - just like the many great, inspirational managers he watched during his younger days - legendary figures whose names are carved in Liverpool folklore: Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan... And however it turns out on the pitch, win, lose or draw, Eriksson is sure to receive a warm, heartfelt reception at Anfield. A number of former Liverpool players have already been confirmed to form part of Erikssonâs squad: Jerzy Dudek, Fabio Aurelio, Martin Skrtel, Djibril Cisse, Sander Westerveld while Ryan Babel will play a half with each team. More names are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Tickets for the Legends game are priced at Â£28 for adults, Â£8 for juniors and Â£18 for over 65s. Last year, Eriksson was forced to quit his post as advisor to Swedish third-tier side IF KarlstadÂ due to health problems. It was his most recent position in the game - and a career that spanned over four decades and included managerial posts at Benfica, Roma, Fiorentina, Sampdoria, Lazio, Manchester City and Leicester among others. His most successful spell was in Italy with Lazio, with whom he won the Serie A title, UEFA Cup, European Cup Winnersâ Cup and four domestic cups - two each of the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa.","Last year, Eriksson was forced to quit his post as advisor to Swedish third-tier side IF KarlstadÂ due to health problems.

However, Barcelona are keeping their options open, and one coach that they have taken a liking to is Sporting CPâs Ruben Amorim. As per Catalunya Radio, Barcelona have probed theÂ possibility of appointing Amorim as Xaviâs successor. The 39-year-old is reportedly keen on taking the reins at the Catalan giants, although there is a big stumbling block â he has a â¬30m release clause. If thereâs no way around this, Barcelona would surely have to look elsewhere. It would be a shame for them, as he looks to be one of the best possible candidates for the position, at least on paper.","If thereâs no way around this, Barcelona would surely have to look elsewhere.

They will be without Jude Bellingham in Germany though.  Carlo Ancelotti is set to stack the midfield according to Marca, making just one change from the side that beat Girona 4-0. Nacho Fernandez is back from injury, and will return in central defence in their mind,Â  with Aurelien Tchouameni stepping into midfield, in place of Jude Bellingham. It seems most likely that Fede Valverde would push further forward. Diario AS differ, believing that Ancelotti will go for a more orthodox Bellingham replacement in Brahim Diaz. They see Nacho returning too, but in place of Lucas Vazquez, with Dani Carvajal shifting to right-back. Thibaut Courtois, Eder Militao, David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger remain on the injury list with Bellingham. Young defenders Jacobo Ramon and Alvaro Carrillo have been called up should Ancelotti need them. RB Leipig come into the match without major injury issues, and are expected to put out a team with plenty of attacking talent too. Marco Rose is likely to go with a 4-4-2 featuring Benjamin Sesko and Lois Openda up front. Behind them, Dani Olmo and Xavi Simons will provide plenty of creativity too. Their defensive issues are the big concern for the Bundesliga side though, with 10 goals conceded in their last four games, and just one clean sheet in their last 16 matches.","RB Leipig come into the match without major injury issues, and are expected to put out a team with plenty of attacking talent too.

Romelu Lukaku kept up his hot scoring form by netting the equalizer to give Roma a 1-1 draw at Feyenoord. Brazilian winger Igor PaixÃ£o put the hosts ahead with a header in the first-half injury time before Lukaku nodded home in the 67th after a meeting a cross into the box.  It was Lukakuâs sixth goal of this seasonâs Europa League and he now has 21 in his last 18 games in the competition. It is the third time in three years that the two teams are playing each other in Europe, including the 2022 Europa Conference League final which Roma won 1-0 to give Jose Mourinho another major trophy. This was the first European game in charge for former Roma captain Daniele De Rossi, who replaced the fired Mourinho as coach last month.

Although Barcelona are in a very poor moment currently, the Galicians have lost their last three matches at home, so thereâs no guarantee that they will be able to take advantage.  However, Benitez has been handed a boost ahead of welcoming the Catalan giants to Balaidos, as MD have reported that Jonathan Bamba will return to training with Celta on Friday ahead of the match. Bamba has been away with Ivory Coast for the last six weeks, and he helped them win their home Africa Cup of Nations, defeating Nigeria in the final last weekend. Bamba has been a key player for Celta Vigo since signing last summer.

However, given the recent form of the two teams, it will be very difficult for La Real to pull off a result.  Imanol Alguacilâs side are winless in their last four matches across all competitions, failing to score in any of those. Despite this, PSG boss Luis Enrique fully expects a very stern test, as he told the media on Tuesday ahead of the first leg in Paris 24 hours later, as per Relevo. â(La Real) is a very balanced club that has been playing very good seasons and very good football for these last six years, I would even say before that too. They are collecting the rewards for their good work as a club over the years. â(Imanol) is at home, with a very intelligent philosophy, throwing a lot of people out of the house. A lot of players come out of the academy and they sign well.â The big test for Real Sociedad will be whether they can pick up a positive result in Wednesdayâs first leg. If they can stay in the tie, they will have a decent chance of progressing, with the second leg in front of their own fans at the Reale Arena.","The big test for Real Sociedad will be whether they can pick up a positive result in Wednesdayâs first leg.

La Liga president Javier Tebas has confirmed Barcelona were in advanced talks with Messi over moving back to Spain but an agreement could not be reached between both parties.  âBecause of Messi and Barcelonaâs desire, I saw a return as closeâ, as per quotes from Kick, via the Daily Mirror. âI saw it as possible.

Confirmation that the league had given its backing to the deal was contained within an update to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday evening. The club are still awaiting Football Association approval. The period in which holders of Class A shares can tender them for sale has been extended from February 14 until 23:59pm on February 16. Ratcliffe  So far 36.7 per cent of Class A shares have been tendered, already enough to complete the 25 per cent acquisition. Ratcliffeâs offer is capped at 25 per cent, so even though more shares are available, that is the most which will be purchased. It is understood Premier League approval is contingent on the deal being completed, and therefore the league will not confirm it has given approval until or unless that happens. However, club sources say the process is now moving positively towards completion. It was announced on Christmas Eve that the Ineos chairman had agreed to buy a 25 per cent stake in the Red Devils in a deal that included investing a further 300 million US dollars (Â£238million) into their infrastructure. As well as buying Class B shares held by the Glazer family, the announcement confirmed Ratcliffe would offer to acquire up to 25 per cent of all Class A shares at a price of 33 US dollars (Â£26) per share.

Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are trying to implement radical change behind the scenes at Old Trafford, having already poached Omar Berrada from Manchester City to be their CEO. The Premier League approved Ratcliffe's 25 per cent buy-out on Tuesday and full ratification is expected next week with FA approval. Ashworth, who used to work for Brighton, has emerged as their one and only target for the inaugural position as sporting director at Old Trafford. And according to the Manchester Evening News, the transfer guru is keen to defect from the Magpies and join the new operation in the North West.  The report goes on to claim that Ratcliffe is so confident of getting his man that no alternatives have been contacted for the role. Ashworth brings 24 years of experience from Peterborough, Cambridge, West Brom, the FA, Brighton, and Newcastle. He was technical director for the Seagulls from spring 2019, helping to oversee a revolution in the club's playing style and recruitment with Graham Potter as manager. Ashworth joined Newcastle in June 2022. His departure from the AMEX Stadium saw him put on gardening leave for an extended period of time while his initial move to St James' Park was negotiated. Last month, Mail Sport reported that Newcastle were confident they could keep Ashworth, with chief executive Darren Eales emphasising how 'happy' he is with the Toon. Ratcliffe, who completed his Â£1.3billion buy-out of a 25 per cent stake in the club in December, wants to change football operations.  That includes using a data-led approach, chasing younger players in the market, and taking a scythe to Erik ten Hag's influence over transfers. Director of data science Dominic Jordan, who inaugurated the role in 2022, said he expects his field to be 'transformational' for the side. United's current boardroom doesn't boast a sporting director, a decision that has been heavily criticised during a period when the club's recent recruitment has been scrutinised.","United's current boardroom doesn't boast a sporting director, a decision that has been heavily criticised during a period when the club's recent recruitment has been scrutinised."

If Cote dâIvoireâs narrative arc was written into a movie, youâd stand up, spike your popcorn into the sticky carpet, and storm out of the cinema before demanding a refund for the utter madness youâve just witnessed. Things like the Ivory Coastâs AFCON journey donât happen in real life. They just donât. You do not host the tournament, crumble to a 4-0 shellacking by Equatorial Guinea, and sack your manager after your final group stage game, only to qualify as one of the best third-placed teams. You also donât then put the assistant manager in charge of a senior football team for the first time in his entire f*cking life, knock the reigning champs, Senegal, out in the round of 16 via a last-minute equaliser and a penalty shootout. Other things you simply donât do might include snatching an equaliser at the death of the quarter-final against Mali, followed by a 122nd-minute winner. Or, if you had miraculously achieved all of the aforementioned fantasy novel bullsh*t, youâre extremely unlikely to then beat DR Congo in the semifinal with a goal from your talismanic striker Sebastien Haller on the anniversary of his first goal following a recovery from testicular cancer. That would be silly. No one would believe it. Get rid of the script, start again, youâre being daft. Happened, though, didnât it? Only bloody happened. By the time the AFCON final started last night, none of us were ruling anything out. Usually, rational people were mumbling to themselves, wide-eyed, about fate and zombie elephants. The Ivorians were up against Nigeria, whoâd already beaten them 1-0 in the group stages. It seemed like we were set for a repeat of that game, as the Super Eagles took the lead through William Troost-Ekong on 38 minutes. The world seemed a little more real again. Nigeria, with perhaps the strongest squad in the tournament, were unlikely to give up a 1-0 advantage. The Ivorians werenât immortal, after all. Zombie elephants arenât real. Zombie elephants canât hurt you. Franck Kessie then headed an equaliser just after the hour mark and suddenly elephants seem quite scary again. They couldnât, could they? Nahhhhh. Then, it happened. The ultimate get the f*ck out moment. The moment that will make your great-great-grandkids think youâre lying to them when you recount this story to them via hologram from beyond the grave. Sebastien Haller gets his big toe on the end of an Adingra cross to send the ball spinning into the side netting with less than eight minutes of normal time to play. Haller, of all people. Haller, who, following the rejuvenation of his career at Ajax, smashing goals in for fun, had only just made his big, potentially career-defining move to Dortmund, only to have his life and career halted by a terrifying diagnosis of testicular cancer. Six months of treatment and, thank goodness, Haller made a full recovery and was back on the pitch and back scoring goals. This particular goal, though. This was the one. This was as good as it gets. Les Elephants held out until the final whistle to win only their third AFCON, in front of a delirious home crowd including a euphoric-looking Didier Drogba, with a makeshift coach, and a new national hero. You might not believe in fate, but whatever just happened in the Cote dâIvoire, it felt a little bit supernatural. The sort of thing that gets turned into legend and, eventually, myth.

Josip Stanisic, the man on loan from Bayern, opened the scoring against a static defence in the 18th minute before Alex Grimaldo doubled the lead five minutes into the second half. An exclamation point was added in stoppage time when Manuel Neuer came up for a corner and missed the ball, with Jeremie Frimpong firing into an empty net.

Eintracht Frankfurt could not close the gap however, as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Bochum. Omar Marmoush put Eintracht in front after 14 minutes, but Moritz Broschinski levelled three minutes later and that is how it stayed.

Francesco Acerbi had headed Inter in front after 17 minutes, but Gianluca Mancini levelled before Stephan El Shaarawy put Roma in front a minute before the break. Marcus Thuram levelled four minutes into the second half and Inter were back in front when Angelino put through his own net in the 56th minute, with Alessandro Bastoniâs stoppage-time goal making sure. Roma sit just one point above neighbours Lazio after their 3-1 win away to Cagliari. They led through Alessandro Deoilaâs 26th-minute own goal, with Ciro Immobile doubling the lead early in the second half. Moments later Gianluca Gaetano pulled one back but Felipe Andersonâs 65th-minute goal calmed Lazio nerves. Sassuolo edged away from the relegation zone with a point from a 1-1 draw with Torino, as Andrea Pinamontiâs early goal was quickly cancelled out by Duvan Zapata. Paris St Germain moved 11 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, beating Lille 3-1 with Kylian Mbappe kept in reserve. Yusuf Yazici gave the visitors an early lead, but Goncalo Ramos levelled before Alexsandro, at fault for PSGâs opener, made it worse by slicing into his own net. Randal Kolo Muani then made sure of the win, with Mbappe rested ahead of Wednesdayâs Champions League match against Real Sociedad.

The Blues are currently enduring a woful season and sit 11th in the Premier League table after 10 defeats in 23 matches. It comes after they finished 12th last term in the first season after Todd Boehly's takeover of the club in June 2023. Former goalkeeper Cech has suggested a change in ownership is to blame for the west London side's drop off and believes it will take time for them to challenge at the top again. Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'Well you know, there's been a lot of changes obviously there were changes of managers but the takeover obviously itself is a big change you have a new owner with new visions new style of how they want the club to be run.  'And you know that that takes some adaptations you know, it includes the players it includes everybody working for the football club. 'So these things normally take time obviously the team was built certain way but since I've left them there was a complete remake of the of the squad and it's challenging for everybody when you have when you have a lot of changes. Cech believes Chelsea can set their sights on challenging for a top-four finish if they end this season strongly. He added: 'Well if you speak about the league title, obviously this season is not going the way they all wished for. And I think if they can have a really strong end of the season and build up for the next season. 'Maybe that's the season where Chelsea can climb up the table challenge for the top four. And then the season after probably in those the first realistic year I think is to for Chelsea to challenge for the title. Cech was one of the casualties of the Boehly having been fired from his role as been their technical and performance advisor in June 2022. Since his departure, there has been a change in the club's philosophy, with over Â£1billion spent on mostly up and coming young players.","Since his departure, there has been a change in the club's philosophy, with over Â£1billion spent on mostly up and coming young players."

We have a good lead,â MbappÃ© told broadcaster Canal Plus. âThe clean sheet is important for us, weâve been looking for that in the Champions League, although itâs true that they (Sociedad) have not not been scoring much at the moment.â There was relief, too, that MbappÃ© lasted the whole game. MbappÃ©'s sore left ankle kept him on the bench for Saturday's French league game, but he showed no ill effects when he latched onto DembelÃ©'s pass and forced a save in the sixth minute. After that chance, however, PSG's intensity dropped right off. Even though Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil was without goal-scoring midfielder Mikel Oyarzabal and left back Kieran Tierney, the intensity and organization of Sociedad's high pressing pushed PSG back at a subdued Parc des Princes. AndrÃ© Silva glanced a header wide and captain Mikel Merino struck the crossbar with a superb dipping shot from 25 meters moments before the break. âItâs evident that we had trouble getting out of their pressing game in the first half. We should have shown more character to get out of it, as we were eight (players) against six,"" MbappÃ© said. âThe return leg will be more open, they will attack more and we will be given more space. If we get the space over 40 meters, I think we will score over there.â Marquinhos said Enrique gave the players a stern talking to at the break.  âHe was very angry in the dressing room, and thatâs good,â Marquinhos said. âItâs important for the team. He managed to motivate us to bring the ball out more from the back.â MbappÃ©'s goal took pressure off his teammates and allowed the 21-year-old Barcola â a summer signing from Lyon â more freedom to attack and net his first goal in the Champions League. âIt's a childhood dream come true,â Barcola said. Despite huge spending, PSG has been eliminated from the last 16 five times in the past seven seasons. A quarterfinal place seems within reach, however, heading to San SebastiÃ¡n for the return leg on March 5.

The Norwegian forward played the full 90 minutes in Denmark as he battled on despite receiving tragic family news that Tone Rasdal - the mother of his father Alfie, passed away on Saturday at the age of 80. An obituary for Rasdal read: 'Our dear mother, mother-in-law, grandmother, grandmother and great-grandmother Tone Rasdal died peacefully today, aged 80.' According to Norwegian outlet Nettavisen, Rasdal passed away at a nursing home in Sivdaheimen in Bryne, located on the south coast of Norway, with her funeral set to take place next week.  Her death came on the same day Haaland had played for Man City against Everton - which saw him bag a brace. It is unclear whether the star forward had been informed of the news at the time of the match. Another Norwegian website - Dagbladet - claims Rasdal was a teacher and a principal at a school in the region of Time, close to where she passed away in Norway. She had four children with partner Astor, including Alfie - who would go on to become a Premier League star, featuring for Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Man City.  Her grandson would also become a huge football star too as Alfie's son Erling followed in his footsteps by playing for City and has become one of the greatest strikers in world football. Haaland has had a superb season for City once again - building on the 52 goals from 53 games he bagged last year to add 21 strikes from 26 games in this campaign. His incredible lethal ability in front of goal helped City win the treble last season, though he has been set back by injury issues in the last two months. Haaland missed 12 games this season after an ankle injury, coupled with a stress fracture on his foot.","Haaland missed 12 games this season after an ankle injury, coupled with a stress fracture on his foot."

The former Liverpool skipper has only made one appearance since returning to Europe from Al-Ettifaq but could already be named as captain of the club. As reported by The Mirror, Henderson will wear the armband when they travel to Heerenveen on Sunday. This is due to former Spurs winger Steven Bergwijn, the current captain, being sidelined by injury. The report continues to state that Henderson donning the armband may not be a one-off as it is understood Ajax coach John van't Schip could look to make him the permanent captain.   It is believed that Henderson has had such a 'positive effect on the dressing room' that he could be named as permanent captain. The Englishman has seen his fellow Ajax midfielder Kenneth Taylor heap praise on his, revealing that he has been a huge boost to the dressing room. Jordan's presence in the team and dressing room is huge,' Taylor revealed. 'Everyone can tell he has played at top level in Europe and in England for years. Jordan is a leader and a coach on the pitch in such a good and natural manner. 'He is constantly supporting young players, he sees things quicker than others and tells us how to anticipate all the time. 'That is already resulting in a more fluent playing style. Simple things are now stuck in the head of the players, which creates a lot of automatic things in our game. I love all that.' It remains to be seen as to whether he will be named as the permanent captain or share duties with Bergwijn, but he will take the armband on Sunday for the first time since his move to the Netherlands.","It remains to be seen as to whether he will be named as the permanent captain or share duties with Bergwijn, but he will take the armband on Sunday for the first time since his move to the Netherlands."
784,De Jong could leave Barcelona despite being left 'very upset' by Man Utd saga,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/De-Jong-could-leave-Barcelona-despite-being-left-very-upset-by-Man-Utd-saga/3299060,11 Feb,"Barcelona are mulling over whether or not to sell Frenkie de Jong in the summer amid interest in the midfielder from Manchester United.  The Dutch playmaker, 26, was heavily linked with a move to the Red Devils back in the summer of 2022 and it was even outlined at the time that United had agreed the framework of a deal worth Â£70million with Barcelona for De Jong's services. De Jong decided to snub interest from the Premier League giants at the time in order to stay at Barcelona - but it seems as though the Spanish champions could attempt to cash in on the former Ajax star for a second time at the end of the season. According to a new report Relevo, the Barcelona hierarchy 'have doubts' over De Jong and a summer sale has not be ruled out as the club strive to improve their financial health. While Barcelona were open to doing business with Manchester United last summer, De Jong never seemed to be on board with a move to the Premier League. Erik ten Hag quickly installed De Jong as his primary transfer target after working with the player at Ajax and it's understood that the Dutchman's interest in his compatriot still stands. Spanish outlet Sport reported back in October that the saga - which rumbled on all summer - had left De Jong feeling 'very upset' given Barcelona had continued with their attempts to offload him even after it had been made clear that the player wished to stay at the Nou Camp. De Jong made it clear last month, though, that any ill-feeling between him and the club in relation to the saga was gone. In an interview with Dutch outlet NOS, De Jong said: ""I am at the club where I always wanted to be, where I dreamed of [Barcelona]."" When he was then quizzed about the possiblity of experiencing a new league and whether or not that held much appeal, he added: ""Possibly. But Iâm very satisfied at Barca. It's always difficult to say. For now I feel good here!"" Manchester United are expected to be active in the summer transfer window and a midfielder could be on Ten Hag's wishlist with Casemiro - who was signed from Real Madrid after talks with De Jong collapsed - expected to move on.",Manchester United are expected to be active in the summer transfer window and a midfielder could be on Ten Hag's wishlist with Casemiro - who was signed from Real Madrid after talks with De Jong collapsed - expected to move on.
785,WSL seeks bids for Â£20m annual TV contract to show all matches live next season,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/WSL-seeks-bids-for-%C2%A320m-annual-TV-contract-to-show-all-matches-live-next-season/3301949,1 day ago,"Every Womenâs Super League game is set to be broadcast live from next season in a historic first for football in this country.  Mail Sport has learned that the WSL tender document issued to broadcasters this month features all 132 league games, with 56 to be sold exclusively and the remaining 76 available on a non-exclusive basis. The WSL have not secured the 3pm Saturday slot demanded by Karen Carney in her womenâs football review as they have yet to get agreement from the Premier League and EFL to pursue a revision on the UEFA blackout, with Saturday lunchtime and Sunday afternoons remaining as the most common kick-off times. In an attempt to gain an increase from the existing Â£7.75million-a-year deal the WSL have responded by making every match available for broadcast, which it is hoped will attract bids from beyond current rights holders Sky Sports and the BBC. Under the terms of the existing deal that expires in the summer Sky broadcast 35 matches-a-season and the BBC 22, with the rest streamed for free on the FAâs website.   Sky contribute around Â£7m of the current contract and during initial discussions are understood to have argued that the value of the WSL has not risen significantly despite the huge growth in interest in womenâs football, a view supported by their subscription and advertising data. The WSL are understood to be seeking a new TV contract worth between Â£15m and Â£20m-a-year, and have reached the conclusion that their best way of doubling their money is to sell every game. The strategy is similar to that which saw the National Womenâs Soccer League in the United States secure a remarkable Â£50m-a-year deal last year by selling packages to four different broadcasters. The WSLâs tactics also mirror those used successfully by the Premier League and EFL to secure bigger TV deals in recent years, albeit taken to extremes.    From next season a staggering 1059 of the 1891 matches in the EFL will be broadcast live on Sky, while from the 2025/26 campaign 270 of the 380 Premier League games will be televised live. Sky are also televising every Super League fixture live for the first time in the new season which begins this week, although some will be shared with the BBC. Sky and the BBC are set to bid again, while TNT and DAZN have also expressed interest in securing some of the packages.","Sky and the BBC are set to bid again, while TNT and DAZN have also expressed interest in securing some of the packages."

The PA news agency understands the club hope to bring in Newcastleâs Dan Ashworth to fill the vacant role. Sir Jim Ratcliffeâs deal to acquire a 25 per cent stake in the Old Trafford giants and take control of football operations is expected to be completed next week and the Ineos chairmanâs determination to hit the ground running has seen his team move to strengthen Unitedâs football leadership group, with recruitment a particular area of focus.

The appointment of a sporting director is absolutely key to that and while Ten Hag wants their philosophies to be aligned he will have no sway over who is brought in. âI think it is very important you are on one page about football philosophy, about football tactics, about the profiles of the players you need in the team so it is very important to have very good communication so you get the right players,â said the manager. âIt is one of the most important factors to develop a good team, that you have the right players but also the right characters. âThat means you have to do the right work and be aligned and itâs a long process to get the right players in. âI have worked in several situations where sometimes I was alone in charge, sometimes I had co-operation.

I donât know anything about changes. âI talk with the new sporting organisation but it is not up to me. My focus point at this moment is on this team.â Ten Hag admits the investment and input from Ineos has provided a boost throughout the club, even at first-team level. âYou see, you feel, that ambition and it brings a mood and brings a spirit which belongs to this club,â the Dutchman added. âI think the players, the staff are very aligned with the ambitions of Ineos because thatâs why are here, thatâs why weâre playing for Man Utd.

A report in The Sun also went onto explain how Greenwood and his partner are relishing their new life in Spain. A source said: 'They have had time and space to enjoy being a young family and are facing up to the challenge of living in a foreign country. 'He has had lots of problems off the pitch in his short career, but he finally seems to be addressing them and sorting himself out. 'He has made some good friends with teammates and Harriet has been welcomed by some of the WAGs. They like being able to go out in Madrid without feeling like everyone is watching them.' Greenwood backed up these claims in an interview with Getafe's club media last month and thanked their supporters as he said: 'Everythingâs fine, I adapted pretty quickly. My team-mates took me under their wing and Iâve just been happy ever since coming here, training and playing the games. 'The fans mean a lot to me. The best feeling so far is when I scored my first goal here at the stadium and it meant a lot to me, I heard the fans quite a lot. 'Also we had the training day and a lot of fans came out and watched so we always appreciate the fans, theyâre like an extra man out there on the pitch when theyâre out there supporting us.'   Getafe are currently 10th in LaLiga, with Jose Bordalas' side five points off the European places. Speaking in December, Bordalas praised Greenwood's impact since arriving at the club. He said: 'I said it from day one, he is a fantastic player and he would reach his best level little-by-little, (and) we have treated him really well.' Greenwood is contracted at United until 2025, although he is not expected to play for the club again.","Greenwood is contracted at United until 2025, although he is not expected to play for the club again."
795,Arsenal news: Gunners 'losing patience' with Kai Havertz amid Ivan Toney transfer warning,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Arsenal-news-Gunners-losing-patience-with-Kai-Havertz-amid-Ivan-Toney-transfer-warning/3301656,2 days ago,"Arsenal's Premier League title charge has been revitalised thanks to results since the winter break - but that hasn't taken the focus fully away from transfers.  Following Sunday's stunning 6-0 win away to West Ham, the Gunners will look to make it five wins in a row when they travel to face Burnley on Saturday. In the meantime, though, Mikel Arteta is assessing his squad with an eye on next season and the arrival of a new striker has been heavily mooted amid doubts over the durability of Gabriel Jesus and quality of Eddie Nketiah, who's seemingly fallen further down the pecking order when it comes to leading the line. Here's a round-up of the latest news from the Emirates. Kai Havertz is expected to be put up for sale by Arsenal this summer, according to reports in Spain. It's claimed by Fichajes that Havertz, who joined the Gunners for Â£65million last summer, is beginning to test Arsenal's patience. The German forward's lack of attacking output and struggles in adapting to Mikel Arteta's style of play are cited as the two reasons, but it's added that previous admirers Real Madrid aren't willing to cough up the Gunners' asking price of a similar fee to what they paid Chelsea. Havertz, 24, has failed to score since the turn of the year. Rio Ferdinand has warned Arsenal transfer target Ivan Toney that he'll need to keep a lid on his confidence should he eventually get a big-money move to the Emirates. Brentford striker Toney raised eyebrows on Saturday after saying in jest that manager Thomas Frank doesn't want him at the club next season due to his contract only having one year left and several clubs interested. When Ferdinand was told by one of his podcast co-hosts that the 27-year-old England hopeful has 'next-level confidence' and believes that 'no-one can chat to him', the former Manchester United defender replied: ""He won't last long then. I don't think that is him, but if he goes into the dressing room, a strong dressing room like Arsenal, and thinks, 'No-one can chat to me' - that's where the dressing room will be tested."" Aaron Ramsdale has suggested that it was Arsenal teammate Jorginho who helped persuade boss Mikel Arteta to bring 16-year-old Ethan Nwaneri on for a late cameo during Sunday's 6-0 win at West Ham. Midfielder Nwaneri made only his second appearance for the Gunners when he replaced Gabriel Martinelli after 77 minutes. ""The players on the bench [were] whispering, 'Ethan in' - which is a great thing to hear,"" Arteta revealed post-match. Now on Instagram, Ramsdale has hinted that it was Jorginho making the case.

796,Ancelotti has three options to replace Jude Bellingham during injury absence,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ancelotti-has-three-options-to-replace-Jude-Bellingham-during-injury-absence/3299573,11 Feb,"Jude Bellingham has undoubtedly been Real Madridâs main man this season. The English midfielder, who scored his 20th goal in Los Blancos colours against Girona on Saturday, has only missed a couple of matches due to injury or suspension throughout the campaign, although that is soon about to change.  Bellingham suffered an ankle injury against Girona, one that will keep him out of action for the next three weeks. It is a major blow for Real Madrid, especially as they begin their Champions League knockout campaign against RB Leipzig on Tuesday. As per MD, Real Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti has three main options available to him as Bellingham replacements. Brahim Diaz has tended to play instead of the 20-year-old whenever he hasnât started, so he looks to be in pole position. Luka Modric also has a chance, and he would bring experience, which could be needed against Leipzig. Finally, and probably the most unlikely option, there is Joselu Mato, whose inclusion would likely see Real Madrid switch to a 4-3-3 if he were to play place of Bellingham. Ancelotti is not expected to switch the system that has worked so well this season, so Brahim or Modric are better placed at this stage.","Finally, and probably the most unlikely option, there is Joselu Mato, whose inclusion would likely see Real Madrid switch to a 4-3-3 if he were to play place of Bellingham.

The Zebrette stunned Juve 1-0 in Turin. Cioffi said, âWe went through difficult moments, but the lads never gave up, leaving everything on the pitch. We fought hard against a team of champions. It was key to read moments well. We were strong and lucky to get the best result."" On Giannetti, he added: âHe is a silent leader. He doesn't speak much, but he hits hard. He has brought serenity inside the dressing room, which is something we lacked. âWe didn't accept what the numbers said and we continued working hard with determination. We are pretty balanced now and we are closer to our target, even if it's not over yet.""","âWe didn't accept what the numbers said and we continued working hard with determination.

798,Barcelona have received offers for three significant first team players as busy summer looms,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-have-received-offers-for-three-significant-first-team-players-as-busy-summer-looms/3301804,2 days ago,"Itâs shaping up to be a massively important summer transfer window for Barcelona. Their ongoing financial woes means that significant sales are likely to be required in order for their targets to be signed, and at this stage, their players are not short of interest.  After it was reported on Wednesday that Tottenham Hotspur had submitted an offer for Frenkie de Jong, who could end up being sold this summer, Sport have now reported that two more bids have been received by Barcelona in recent weeks. They are for Ronald Araujo, who has attracted very strong interest from Bayern Munich over the last few months, and Raphinha. In the case of the Uruguayan defender, an offer of â¬70m has been received, which Barcelona are very reluctant to accept as they view Araujo as an untouchable player. In Raphinhaâs case, the proposal received has come from an unnamed club. Barcelona could end up parting ways with two or three key players this summer, something that could be necessary if they are to give their next manager enough funds to secure their signings. The situation will certainly be one to watch over the coming months.","Barcelona could end up parting ways with two or three key players this summer, something that could be necessary if they are to give their next manager enough funds to secure their signings.

799,COLUMN: Atletico Madridâs secret weapon arrives just in time for Champions League clash with Inter,https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/COLUMN-Atletico-Madrid%E2%80%99s-secret-weapon-arrives-just-in-time-for-Champions-League-clash-with-Inter/3301342,14 Feb,"Before Pablo Barrios this season, the last under-21 player to log 1,000+ minutes in a single campaign for Atletico Madrid was Joao Felix in 2019-20. As youâll no doubt recall, that was season one for Felix in Madrid following his â¬126m move, and the dawn of what many thought would be a new superstar of the game.  In other words, it usually requires pretty unique circumstances for Diego Simeone to give prominence to young footballers. Given the lack of examples in recent times, when a player like Barrios does emerge itâs a pretty good clue that heâs been marked as an exceptional case, and that your interest should be piqued. Perhaps the most important caveat of Barriosâ rise this season is that itâs come against the backdrop of disruption. He missed a month through injury between September and October, while a meniscus tear suffered against Feyenoord in November then kept him out for just short of two months. In a campaign where it seems like Simeone hasnât been entirely sure what to do with the third central midfield spot (accompanying Koke and Rodrigo De Paul), a healthy Barrios would have been in line for more prominence than heâs already had. And with over 1,000 minutes to his name in such circumstances, thereâs every chance he would have been a fixture in midfield by now, minus those injury setbacks. That Barrios tends to be involved whenever possible isnât merely down to ability. Of course, it helps, but the growing matter of compatibility between player and team is a big factor too. As his talent comes to the fore, thereâs now (conveniently) a greater need for it than at any other time in the Simeone era. Take their recent 1-1 draw against Real Madrid, for example. Though Atletico clearly intended to approach the game with relative caution and prioritise their defensive shape early on, the home sideâs 62% possession in the opening half hour quickly became suffocating. Where once the idea might have been to simply accept the pattern of territory, heighten the aggression from a deeper defensive shape, and look to claw their way back into the game through counter-attacks, Atleticoâs reaction was channelled in a much different way. To observe Diego Simeone in the opening half hour was to see a man pleading for only one thing: the ball. His repeated message of âtranquiloâ through words and gestures was a request for calm, but more specifically, the calmness to be able to find their football. More than ever under the Argentine there is an onus on his team to be the protagonists, and that requires specific attributes in specific areas of the pitch. Firstly, to be able to construct the type of football they want and have control of the game. And secondly, to be able to move the game forward and be effective once the conditions are there. Atletico are averaging 13.3 sequences of 10+ passes per game in LaLiga this season; a considerable jump from the 2019-20 campaign when Joao Felix first arrived (7.7), and the point at which the teamâs impending evolution really started to become a topic. Koke, meanwhile, is averaging 87 passes per 90 and completing 92% of those in LaLiga this season â by far his two highest marks in a single campaign as it stands. Viewed within what has happened in recent seasons, the fast-tracking of Barrios in this brave new world for Atletico becomes pretty clear. Itâs not that the 20-year-old is a generational passer, whoâs just so happened to land at the point in which Atletico are well on the way to diversifying their possession play. What Barriosâ natural game brings, however, is a blend of dynamism and technical ability that makes him a problem solver within the teamâs current intention. Even at this early stage of his career, Atletico have a need for his capacity of association. Whether itâs through passing, carrying, or movements off the ball, the youngster already figures as someone who can knit play together across every third of the pitch. The cherry on top of that is his ability to take off on the dribble, which heâs learning to do with increasing efficiency.
Barrios is averaging 2.8 successful take-ons per 90 in LaLiga this season; the most of any Atletico player. At the same time he not only has the best take-on success rate in his side, but across La Liga as a whole (78%), having completed 28 of his 36 attempts in the competition this term.  While dribbling is a characteristic most associated with wingers in todayâs game, and the preferred tool for creating individual advantages in many of the elite teams, for Barrios it speaks more to his comfort in navigating midfield traffic. Indeed, in the age of needing solutions to opposition pressure, the youngster is as much an escape artist as he is advantage creator. Though he retains the latter â especially when playing as an interior and not filling in for Koke â moulding his way of playing into an all-round midfield presence is the task that heâll need to continue to refine. The prize for both Simeone and Barrios, should that reach a point of completion, will be to add the characteristics of a no. 10 in the silhouette of an all-terrain midfielder. âHeâs a boy thatâs grown up as a âllegadorâ from midfield and he has that impulse to carry the ball towards the penalty area to shoot or assist,â said Spain U21 coach Santi Denia, speaking back in September. âI donât like to curb the players because you take away their natural characteristics. What [Barrios] has to do is learn to pick his moments when to let himself go.â Itâs worth remembering that Barrios has only started 15 games in La Liga to date, while heâs only played the full match on five occasions. For all the promise heâs shown in his first eight months in the senior setup, his biggest improvements will only be achieved by playing and competing on a weekly basis across multiple years. But having already worked his way into Simeoneâs plans at 20 years of age, one might say the biggest barrier has already been surpassed.","But having already worked his way into Simeoneâs plans at 20 years of age, one might say the biggest barrier has already been surpassed."
